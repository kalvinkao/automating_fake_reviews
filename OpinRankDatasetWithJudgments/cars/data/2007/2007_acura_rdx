<TEXT>I'm a sales rep and drive approximately 40,000-45,000 miles a year for work. I've owned the RDX for a little more than two years and have 94,000 miles on it. I LOVE THIS CAR! The quality is excellent, the power & handling is excellent. The features of the tech pkg are great and reliable. I get compliments about this car all the time because of its styling and luxury. As long as you don't stand on the throttle and use up the turbo all the time, you get respectable gas mileage. I usually get 20-21 mpg in mixed driving conditions. When I'm aggressive I get 18-19 mpg. Due to a sporty suspension some may not like to feel every bump. You get a lot for the money. Compare the features to others.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blue Tooth Technology Backup camera with right side mirror that tilts, which makes this car easy to park. The controls are at your fingertips. Great power. It has a lot of room for a little SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Absolutely great car. Tech package is easy to use. Here's the bad things... interior plastic scratches easy, 19 to 20 mpg avg., 92 octane gas. That being said this is the best car I've ever owned. I'm a "car nut" and backyard mechanic, this car is extremely easy to maintain. I'll drive this car till it dies! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Although some call it an SUV it's not. I don't drive it off road and don't plan to but on snow covered mountain roads it out handles my 4x4 Explorer in every way. The SH-AWD is one of the best I've ever driven. On performance, I didn't buy it as a race car but I drive over a mountain pass to work every day and this car doesn't work very hard climbing the grade AND with just over 50K miles, I'm averaging 24 MPG. I'm confused as to why so many complain about poor fuel economy. I'm guessing that mileage figures vary with driving habits? It's not a race car... don't drive it like one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased an '07 RDX brand new when they first came out (we purchased in Aug '06). We are in the process of selling it, not because we want to, but because our family has simply outgrown it. We put 40k miles on it in almost 3 years of ownership and have thoroughly enjoyed the RDX. We've used it around town & on family trips. Extremely reliable. Quiet ride. Incredibly comfortable interior w/ awesome styling. Multiple compartments for storage, & many tech features. Front & back seats are quite roomy & backseat easily folds down flat (2/3 / 1/3) to expand cargo space. The AWD RDX drives better than most performance cars - handling is incredible & it is a fun, solid drive/ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is great. Oops I mean SUV. Well same thing real for this "CUV". Sometimes you forget it's an SUV with its excellent acceleration and sport suspension. You feel the road unlike any other SUV out there. It feels more like my friend's BMW 3s. Apart from performance Acura offers excellent interior design with everything you need, really. Comfortable heated leather seats, Dual zone AC & so on...The super handling AWD also helps on snow and offroad. even though this car is not designed for offroading I still do it and it feels just as good as my highlander on dirt and light muddy roads. Only thing I'm unhappy about is the MPG in hwy. I get 21MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I chose the RDX because I wanted sport sedan like handling and power but the utility of an SUV. Gas mileage is not as bad as some say. If I ease into the throttle, I can get about 25mpg highway with some city driving. Ride is firm, but you get lots of grip. Sport mode tranny is neat but not necessary. This is my first turbo engine and overall I like the power surge; surprising that a 2.3L can feel this strong in a 3,900lb vehicle. Turbo lag is not bad; spools up faster than the 2008 CX7 and 2009 Subaru Forester I drove. RDX felt more powerful than CX7 despite having less advertised hp and one fewer gear. Glad I spent the extra money and chose the RDX over the CX7. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned Hondas for years but strayed to AUDI a few years ago. I loved the AWD of my AUDI but hated the UNreliability - I'll NEVER have another Audi. Finding AWD for under $40K was a challenge. LOVE my RDX - a suped-up Honda with AWD! All the bells and whistles of a more expensive model but at a great price. Gas mileage is wonderful when I drive it like a 4 cyl. When I need the power of a 6 cyl, I have it with the Turbo. Drive it like a 6 cyl and you'll too complain about the gas mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first and last Acura. At 5K the driver's floor mat was worn through. After some argument, the dealer agreed to replace it under warranty. The replacement lasted about the same. While the overall interior quality appears acceptable, the carpeting and floor mats are very cheap. Mileage is fair, but you must use premium fuel. For the money, the vehicle is not worth the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I decided to trade in my TL for this because I wanted all wheel drive. I was disappointed to find out that the car lacked some features I thought would be standard across all models. Namely, the navigation screen was no longer touch screen (as my TL from a few years prior had been). I also found both the gas range prediction and mpg to be terrible. On a drive across the country in a torrential downpour, I checked my range vs. the nearest gas station. At the time (about 20 miles away), I had about 12-15 extra miles according to the trip computer. Suddenly, about 10 miles away it jumped to 9 miles and I wondered if I would even make it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning this vehicle for a year I am already tired of the non responsive automatic transmission. I have driven manual transmissions for most of my life, but I wanted to have a SUV for the snow and portability. I have to say I love everything else about this vehicle. The handling is great, comfortable, roomy, tech package kicks, even the turbo 4 isn't so bad. But the paddle shifters and transmission are sub par. Shifts are slow and sloppy. This vehicle should have made with a 6 spd manual. Also the GPS is outdated.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace a small hatchback that got totaled in an accident. I feel very comfortable with all its safety features, and it handles very well. I never was fan of SUVs, but I really love this car. I was looking at the BMW, but in the end I thought the RDX was simply a better ride. I also like the fact that I don't see these very often since it's a new model. I live in L.A., and I think I've only seen one or two others on the street. It's a very hip car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My RDX has many great technological features, however some important ones to me were left off. My TL had seat memory for the drivers seat. This was a great feature for me because people at the dealership move the seat all the time, and it takes me a week to get it perfect again. No power seat for the passenger is also missed by my wife. Drivers side mirror does not tilt down. Rear lift gate should be remote controlled both from the remote lock / unlock and the dash as the trunk was on the TL. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The technology package I thought was fairly priced compared with most autos. I also like the all-wheel drive as I live in up-state NY and we usually have a lot of snow. Paddle shifting is nice and get you better gas mileage if used properly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is not the perfect car, but it is the perfect choice for the entry level small-luxo-SUV market. Felt the RAV4 and CX7 were not as refined. X3 is the only real competitor in this segment. The X3 was a nice car, but would cost about $10K more similarly equipped. I thought the ride was a bit fairer on the BMW, but I felt the handling and power on the RDX was superior. It has ridicoulous amounts of technology, plenty of power, and sport-sedan like handling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the RDX tech package for about 2 months now. Love the bluetooth and other tech features. Car has the room I need without being too big. Would have preferred manual transmission. I find the car very comfortable, I see some complaints about the ride, I have had cars on either side of the RDX and personally wouldn't want to give up any of the fine handling that would undoubtedly be lost with a more plush ride. I would have considered the 21 MPG that I am getting fine several years ago. Next time around I can't imagine that I would even consider a car with this type of mileage. Very happy with RDX quality, feel, and image.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is really fun to drive. There's basically no turbo lag; hit the gas, and off you go. It's surprisingly quick. The real joy comes from the SH-AWD system, which helps you stick to the road in any conditions, but especially when things get slick. The gas mileage is a bit worse than advertised, but still better than most, if not all, SUVs. The standard RDX comes with so much standard, you're better off buying a 3rd party nav system, and saving a bunch on the sticker. With so much standard, why pay another $4K for bluetooth and a back-up camera? Overall, a great buy at the standard level!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first "suv." My previous cars included an Acura Integra and a Mercedes CLK320. It took about a month to adjust to a bumpier ride, but the handling is very similar to a car and not a truck. The sound system is excellent and the free XM radio for a couple months is nice too. The navigation system is also my first and I am thrilled with the detail in various map specs. The only real issue so far is that the battery mysteriously died at 1000 mi. Without a key in the ignition almost all electrical things shut off within 30 seconds of removal which makes it difficult to drain the battery. Overall, I am fairly happy with it so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the RDX for two months and think it is a blast to drive. I had an A4 1.8T and suffered through turbo lag. There is no lag whatsoever. This car (it's not really an SUV) really goes! The trade-off is fuel economy. Based on the computer, it seems like a 1/2 gallon is used each time I accelerate rapidly. I am getting 22-23 highway and 11-13 in city. Very comfortable seats. Audio, navigation, XM and traffic is fun but there is so much functionality it can be distracting while driving at first. Read the manual! I am disappointed in the wind noise from the driver side door at highway speeds. Hard to detect this on test drives in urban areas. It overshadows the stereo.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased mine 2 weeks ago and have put on about 800 miles. The RDX handles amazingly and accelerates extremely well, very much like a sports car and far better than any other SUV. The technology package is a must. Acura/Honda has the best navigation system around. The handsfree capability is also impresive. Cargo room is good, as well is storage room in the RDX. Interior build quality is quite good; the leather seats are extermely comfortable. Sound system is, by far, the best I have heard in any car. I have averaged 21 mpg and I'm anticipating a slight gain when the car breaks in. Please keep in mind that I do about 70% highway driving and I am a fairly conservative driver </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>RDX handles like a sports car. All the technology works very well (Navi with realtime traffic, handfree capability). Service intervals are tuned to the individual and monitored by the RDX. Seats are comfortable with lots of room in both front and back. Acura's reliability is among the best </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Poor gas mileage on premium - 18.3 MPG on mostly freeway driving. I used to average 16.9 MPG with my 4.7 L Jeep 4x4. Very uncomfortable ride on 18" tires - bounces down the road. No interior space or trunk space in spite of being longer than my Grand Cherokee. It feels like you're in an airplane cockpit. No pep when you step on it.

Could easily get less with the peppy turbo if you stand on it. Great handling both on straightaways and curves and a solid built vehicle. A litte stiff ride but quiet interior with awesome stereo system. Love the navigation system but it takes some time to learn the commands. Bluetooth is awesome and great for making/answering calls while traveling. Tilt down right passenger mirror is helpful when backing as well as rear viewing camera. Gauges are well placed and lighted both day and night. Overall pleased so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for my wife. First, this "car" is awesome. It handles like it wants to be a sports sedan, but it has the luxury and utility to make it one of the best crossovers we test drove. The peppy turbocharger makes it jump off the mark, and the "super handling all wheel drive" really improves the cornering. Watch out for the AWD status display on the dash; you should have your eyes on the road whenever you actually need the torque to be redistributed!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this vehicle for almost two months now and can't find anything yet that I do not like about it (2500 miles so far). Yes, it gets between 18-20 MPG, but considering the 15 MPG I was getting with my minivan, I'm certainly not complaining. I don't know how others are driving that get less than 15 MPG, but I've been pretty much right on the rating for the vehicle. Love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I have the RDX-Tech and love the stereo. I can't believe the quality of the sound.

<TEXT>Just purchased an RDX w/ tech - definitely worth the additional $3k. Handles well, navigation, voice, gadgets are awesome. First tank of gas was 21 mpg. Turbo definitely works! As long as you're not looking to haul anything or carry 10 people, definitely look at the RDX as an alternative to any SUV on the market.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's been about 2 month since I purchased 07 RDX right after debut. I have really good image of honda also I had Acura RSX type S before and really liked it. That is why I decided to buy RDX. I am well satisfied with my purchase; however, I see the car is not well built. I happened to find many rattles from dashboards, passenger seat, and twitters. I hate that ticking sounds that dashboards makes. This year RDX missing few things, and I dont see how a car at this pricepoint does not have these as standards: passenger power seat, memory seat for driver seat, auto-dim back and side mirrors.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A great SUV. My first Acura and SUV. My family had a long h/o driving Mazdas but the CX-7 or Murano were no match. The interior is just right and the body design turns heads. I purchased 18" Inspyre RonJon rims and they look great. A definite recommendation to make it a bit sportier helped a bit. As a single male in his 30s I am the demo they were going for and they succeeded!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got it the other day and I am very happy with the car. There are some complaints about the mpg but if one does not step on the accelerator all the time, (as any other car) the number should be very good. The ride is a bit bouncy at times but handling is superb. There is so much kick in the engine you won't even know it is I4. If you are not sure exactly what you want but in the market, take a test drive and you will be sold, esp with tech package. It provides everything and more at 12-14K less than that European "thing". Ext looks appears to be small but once inside, there is plenty of room. Happy motoring... </TEXT>

<TEXT>Before buying, I really suggest taking the local roads rather than just hopping onto the closest freeway with no radio on. I was very annoyed with a shaking/vibrating steering wheel every time I waited in front of the red light. During acceleration, I found the turbo to be rather loud. The gas mileage could also be improved. On the other hand, great visibility and comfortable seats in both front and back. Excellent design as well. The ride is also very comfortable when compared to a sport X3. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's impossible to convey the RDX's overall excellence in a brochure or 10 min test drive. After a week I'm THRILLED. More like an AWD TL station wagon. An SUV that out performs many sports sedans and handles like a Porsche 944. Superb passenger comfort. You sacrifice a little in the cargo area dept., but the car is perfectly adequate for our needs. We installed Thule cross bars and attachments to the factory roof rack. Fuel economy? I'm getting 17-18 city, 22-23 hwy and about 20 mpg combined. That will improve once the engine breaks in. On the gas guzzler issue - compare the RDX to real world mpg from other AWD wagons/small SUVs and you'll find it's better than most of them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Neat car, but stupendously bad gas mileage. We got 11MPG on the first tank, 13MPG on the second tank and have not hit more than 13MPG since. This is computing MPG the old fashioned way. Our local dealer (PA) has more than 20 of these on the lot unsold, they said that they "had deposits" on them, but they don't. I see why now.

<TEXT>I've owned 5 Honda and Acura products before, and this is a HUGE disappointment!! The 4-banger feels sluggish from a standstill (although it's reasonably quick after the initial lag). The engine is very noisy during acceleration, with a lot of turbo whine (even under some cruising conditions) which "wears down on you" after a while. And I was SHOCKED by the horrendous fuel economy. At 16 mpg overall (mix of hwy/city), it's exactly the same as my other vehicle: V8 powered Lexus GX470! Isn't this supposed to be a 4 CYLINDER, SMALL SUV? Helllooo!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car drives nicely although the sportier ride can be a bit too harsh at times for normal day to day driving. Gas mileage has been quite reasonable (12.3L/100km or 19.1 mpg) but I've had to watch the turbo indicator to use the turbo as little as possible. Hills seem to make the turbo kick in quite a bit as expected which really drains the gas quite quickly. Cruising at relatively high speeds while feathering the gas to keep up with traffic seems to make the turbo kick in oddly causing seemingly choppy driving. Blind spots are quite minimal as the mirrors and small size help counteract this.</TEXT>

This past weekend, on a trip to the lake, I got 20.7 avg. I was going through the mountains. In order to get 12-14 mpg, a person must be mashing to pedal and driving on the turbo constantly.

<TEXT>I wanted a small but very luxious SUV and the Acura RDX is the answer. I've owned my RDX for two weeks and I couldn't be happier. I was a little skeptical of going back to a 4 cylinder engine (even though I had owned many 4 cylinder cars in the past) since many newer small SUVs have 6s in them. However, so far I am thrilled with the performance. I have 450 miles on the car and have been averaging better than 22 miles per gallon. The quality of construction and interior cockpit materials are top notch. I highly recommend this car if you want a superior small SUV with far more in the way of goodies (I have the technology package) than the BMW X-3 for about $4000 less in price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The gas mileage on this car is horrific. The EPA is 19/23 but thus far we have had no tank higher than 13 MPG and our average is 12.8 MPG. I took the car to the dealer and they said that "the gas mileage on the RDX isn't great". Wow is that an understatement. If I had known that the mileage would be this bad I would never have purchased this car. The car is great otherwise, but it only takes premium gasoline and the gas costs are now more than double my prior car (a V6 Honda Accord). I am really disappointed that Acura put this car out with such bad gas mileage and there's no way out now, I estimate that my additional annual gas costs will be about $2500 per year, which is insane.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have just taken an RDX for a test drive. The engine is very peppy once it gets into turbo zone. On the downside, the gas mileage is negatively affected by the AWD that cannot be switched off. Another necessary improvement deals with the cargo space (my current TL has a larger trunk). Also, the back seats do not fold down, so there is no way in which you can expand the cargo space (why call it an SUV then?). Overall, the new RDX is a fine car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>An exceptionally fun to drive small suv with technology that will make you grin. Abundant power that is enjoyable but takes some getting used to. The turbo feels well tuned and is mild at first then spools up to deliver smooth, lag free acceleration. It's Nav system and voice recognition software really work well. The stereo is so good you'll be the envy of not just audiophiles but anyone with ears! It's better than the several thousand dollar aftermarket set up I have in my other vehicle. Basically, consider it an impressive blend of MDX utilty, TSX performance and RL luxury. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It is really to early to tell alot, however my first tank of gas seem to yield me only 13.5MPG ... and I did not dog the SUV. This may be because the engine needs to break in, but with my last acura (MDX) getting poor gas milage, I am starting to see a trend. This vehicle is very confortable and the handeling is great (for a SUV). The exterior could be better, but still very nice. I paid just over sticker ($150) ... not bad so far. The brakes seem a bit weak, but again they may need to seat and the intial take off torque is nonexisitant, but once the turbo spools, it has a good punch.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Be very careful of the RDX: the front end has a problem that will need to be addressed - it feels a little like the shocks but it isn't. The turbo has a major problem - my car has been in the shop for over a week they are tearing it down and do not have any idea what is wrong; no warning indicators it may have cracked the head but the dealership isn't talking. They do not know why the turbo is malfunctioning but it appears at the 50,000 mile mark you can look for major issues of course that is when the warranty expires. Powertrain is 70,000. Everytime I have had to deal with warranty issues (3 dealerships) they try not to fix. Good luck sorry you have this car and sorry I have this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The RDX performs well and is clearly well made. It drives like a sedan. It is a very good car for a single person, but storage space for families on trips is relatively poor, especially given only 20 mpg. Bringing a stroller severely limits baggage space. The reality is that if you are going to get poor gas mileage, you might as well buy a larger SUV. My 4-Runner gets about 20 to 22 mpg and has far more space. Seats are very comfortable as long as the ride is on a smooth road. Bumps are unpleasant for back seat passengers. Steering is tight and car handles nicely. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove Mercedes, Lexus, BMW, Range Rover and found the RDX beat them all. Performance, quality and driveability all exceeded my demands. Gas mileage has been an avg of 20 mpg. I spend 3-5 hours a days behind the wheel and this is an awesome ride. Just love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been so fun to drive. Lots of reviews about the stiff ride, but that is one of the things I like about the car. Leather is very nice. Lots of fun gadgets, and voice command works very well. This car offers more for the money than any of its competitors, especially the overpriced BMW X3. If you have a family with a bunch of kids, get the GMC Acadia or Mazda CX-9 in this price-range. But for the young professional looking for an entry-level luxury SUV, this is the bomb. Even if I was willing to pay more for a car, I would still end up with the RDX, that's how much I've loved it. My wife drives a new audi, and has been jealous since I bought this. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Acura is a luxury brand, but this is not a worthy model. It's quick and sporty with a stiff ride. But gas mileage was terrible and we had to replace the front brakes and rotors every 5000 miles. We never felt like it did anything well. If you drove it as a sports SUV with paddle shifters, you paid at the pump and in maintenance. Also, missing some key features at this price including automatic headlights, driver memory settings and iPod interface.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded an '05 TSX for the RDX - needed more room for gear. Not only is the RDX just the right size, it's actually MORE fun to drive!! The SH-AWD system produces such grip and control that it almost feels like you're driving a sports car. I've had no problems/repairs, the mileage is acceptable for an SUV (about 21 mpg), and the fun factor is a 10! The ride is firm, but comfortable. The interior is great (and versatile), the technology package is great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the car for almost a year now. Not impressed by Acura?s quality. Dashboard started to rattle after four months of having the car; now is getting worse, both corners rattle at cooler temperature. Even the sunroof rattles during bumpy road. Turbo lag is definitely noticeable at low RPM with A/C on. I have to put the gear in the Sport mode to minimize the turbo lag when traffic is in a stop-and-go condition; this seems to help. Ride is a little stiff (comments given by everyone who had ridden in my car). Poor gas mileage. I am getting averaged 18 MPG with roughly 60% hwy and 40% surface street driving. Okay, with all the negatives mentioned, I must say the car is a fun car to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love everything about this car except that I have been into the shop with engine troubles about every 2-3 weeks. The engine will suddenly rev uncontrollably and the turbo has stopped working 3 times. This car is downright dangerous to drive without the turbo support to get you moving. The dealer hasn't been able to figure out what is wrong yet -- just keeps erasing the codes which make the problems go away for a short while. Sadly, it's time for a trade-in after only 5 months. So much for Acura quality, which is one of the main reasons I traded in my Saab 9-5 for this.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The nav system is superb. The handling is great and the interior is comfortably laid out. I agree with others that they should have included a memory drivers seat & auto-dimming mirror, but I now see that they've done it with the 2008 model.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had initial questions primarily due to problems with bluetooth, poor gas mileage and limited carrying capacity. But now after several trips and three defective cell phones, believe I made the right choice in the RDX. Gas mileage on last trip was over 24 mpg, seems to improve with each trip. City is routinely 17 mpg. 4th cell phone was the charm, bluetooth now works flawlessly. Love the hard rear deck when using as a sedan, and sport handling is terrific. Wife's Infiniti M35 screen graphics for navigation and rear camera is sharper and clearer, but after looking at several competitors, all have some compromises, but like RDX the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is incredibly fun to drive. I traded up from a TSX and the RDX actually handles/drives better! The SH-AWD system is amazing: I feel glued to the road, no matter how hard I push the RDX. Acceleration is great, and fuel mileage (for me) has been adequate (21 mpg) - not great, but decent for a SUV with this kind of acceleration. The interior is wonderful - comfortable, tasteful, high-tech, full of useful information. Awesome stereo system. The nav system is very user friendly, if a little outdated in its database - but I absolutely love the XM live traffic display, which saves me time every day. Great vehicle!</TEXT>

Overall this car seems very good, not at all underpowered, previous car was a sedan powered by V6 and this little SUV blows it out of the water.

Highway use is phenomenal. Extremely comfortable back support in the driver's seat which comes in handy for my bad back. Two gripes: first is the poor gas mileage (18-19 city driving is disappointing (but what did I expect when I bought a car with turbo, right?)) and the CD player isn't performing well.

<TEXT>We bought a new RDX two months ago and now have been hit with a $4,500 bill to repair the roof?s ?complete collapse.? We mounted a bike rack on the roof, virtually identical to the one Acura sells as an RDX accessory. My son got on the roof to make sure that the bikes were placed in the rack properly ? just like we?ve done on other cars we?ve owned with bike racks. This turned out to be a giant mistake, even though Acura never states anywhere that you shouldn?t do this. This time though the weak, badly- designed Acura roof ?collapsed.? Acura will not cover this huge expense ? so much for customer service. My advice: don?t buy this car; especially if you?re putting something on the roof.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Beside this being my 3rd Honda product (2000 Accord Coupe and then 2005 Acura TSX), I was looking for a bigger car than the TSX, but still wanted that performance and sportiness found in the TSX. The Lexus and BMW equivalents to the RDX can't even compare and the RDX is even more fun to drive than the TL! There are only a few improvements I would like to see, but overall, I have yet to be displeased by this car. Fast, sporty, good looking and yet extremely safe for the family and it has AWD - for a price of under 35K, you can't beat it. MPG for one year has averaged 19.8 - not bad. The car performs totally different in auto versus manual/paddle shifters. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Obviously the stereo kicks and all the other tech features are great - love the back up camera! Acceleration in 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears is incredible around 4000 rpm. Passing a car on the highway is a piece of cake in this thing and the handling is incredible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Obviously I bought the RDX, so I must like it. I needed a smaller SUV than the MDX, but didn't want to sacrifice on features, performance, materials, and quality. Nothing else provided this mix for the money. I initially looked at the CRV, but was very disappointed in the materials and options. I was very impressed with the interior of the RDX. Excellent materials, a mind-blowing stereo, and very comfortable seats. The navigation is top notch, and some German car makers should take notes. So many techie toys too! And this thing handles like a dream. The SH-AWD from the RL is used, and whoa it's amazing. A bit of tire noise, and a bit of turbo lag are my only small gripes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The RDX is a great small SUV. I've had mine almost a year and I love the ride, handling, and sleek interior. The interior and cargo space are much larger than the exterior of the car would indicate. The biggest drawback is the poor gas mileage. I drive 80% in the city and 20% on the highway and I've only averaged 15 MPG. That's pretty bad for a small SUV. Other small annoyances -- the seat belts don't fit snug and rattle; the front seats should slide back further to increase front leg room. Cheaper than the BMW X3 and more luxurious and sportier than the RAV4 or CRV.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Disappointed Owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I thought I could get sport and utility in one vehicle, and be happy, but I was wrong. I find myself disappointed when I want to drive aggressively. Off the line acceleration is poor. You feel like you are anxiously waiting for the vehicle to realize you want it to go. The transmission often seems to be in too high of a gear and the paddle shifters are an absolute joke. The brakes also do not inspire confidence and you can still tell that you are driving an SUV. From a utility standpoint I am disappointed with the ride, comfort of the front seats, and leg room. I can't find a comfortable driving position and actually get sore on trips longer than 20 minutes. Overall I wish I could return it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Even though I wish I could return the vehicle it has some really great features. Once the turbo kicks in, the amount of power is awesome.

<TEXT>The best thing about this vehicle is its high fun-to-drive factor. I have owned 3 VW GTIs because I loved the combination of practical, usable room and sports car handling and acceleration. I never though I could find it in a family car, much less an SUV. The ride may be a bit firm for some, but one feels noticably relaxed even after a long trip. The Tech package is worth every penny. The nav system and stereo are outstanding. The main drawback is gas mileage. I can't get much over 17 in the city and 21 on the highway. But, take a look out there, other than the RX 400h ($55K !!), this combination of FTD factor, room and tech can't be found with 20+ mpg!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The is my first ownership of an SUV, a term I generally despise being somewhat of a car snob. I've owned Acura sedans before, the last being a 2004 TL, so I was mildly skeptical that the RDX could provide the comfort and performance of the TL. This vehicle redefines for me the term sport ute. The straight line performance, particularly while using the paddle shifters, is the equal of the more powerful V6 TL once you get used to the mild turbo lag on initial throttle tip in. And the RDX's handling actually outperforms the TL on my favorite two-lane country roads and city round-abouts. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The so-called Super Handling All Wheel Drive lives up to its name. Fantastic stability and confidence-inspiring handling.

<TEXT>I traded an '03 MDX for this vehicle because I'm single, have no need for a large SUV, and have been very happy with Acura (my 4th Honda product). This vehicle has been a big letdown compared to my MDX. The nimbleness, size and manueverabilty (and handling) are excellent, and what I was looking for, but the 4 cylinder turbo engine is terrible and is really beginning to wear down on me. There is a good amount of turbo lag making it feel sluggish from a start, and the the engine is noisy even when accelerating moderately!! The fuel economy is simply horrendous for a small 4-banger SUV (same as my 7-passenger MDX with a 3.5L V6!!). I will likely end up trading it for something with a decent V6.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I ordered the RDX in May and received it in Sep 06 and it was worth the wait, mostly. Great handling and performance, sporty and comfortable around every corner & on the highway. Acura did a good job bringing the RDX to this class of SUV. But I do wonder why Acura went away from what worked in the MDX family (I left the MDX to come to the RDX). With all the good there are some things missing (see Suggested Improvements). Some toys just detract from the experience and others should have carried over from the MDX. Maybe they should have actually asked Acura drivers what they liked before building something with so many less functional add-ons.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got the car last weekend and am having a great time. This car is quick and responsive yet has all the versatility I need. I go over a mountain/hill in Berkeley/Oakland every day and it is a joy to drive through the woods, taking curves and downshifting manually on the downhills. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Really, this SUV is just too cool. Buy it with the tech package. Its rival crossovers (I test drove Mazda CX7, BMW X3, Ford Fusion, GMC Arcadia) totally pale in comparison. This SUV is both performance-rich and super techy. Beware! With the sport suspension and handling, it does not drive like an old man's Cadillac. Turbo kicks in real nice. Even the base version is fully loaded - moon roof, leather, etc. For an equivalent version, other luxury brands charge you a fortune. Nobody else offers all these features in one car, and for the price. Overall, it's the best "bang for the buck" in its category. Good job Acura!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove all the competitors prior to this purchase. This vehicle truly screams "fun to drive". I almost bought an Infiniti FX35 but could not get over the awesome tech package in the RDX at this price. This crossover SUV almost handles as well as my BMW 330xi. It has great acceleration. In fact if you floor it expect to get pinned to your seat. So far the reliability is 100% better than the Grand Cherokee that it replaced. I cannot help myself from accelerating hard in corners and feeling this SUV handle like a sports sedan. Complaints about poor fuel economy and a harsh ride should be put in perspective. This is meant to be a sporty crossover and it totally meets the criteria.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great stereo system. Love being able to plug my iPod into this sound system. Tech package is great. The navigation system is easy to use very effective. The turbo engine coupled with the AW-SHD makes this vehicle perform like a sports sedan and handle like one. Handles great in snow!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought my RDX a week ago and love it thus far. I originally thought I was going to buy an MDX but after driving both, I prefered the way the RDX handled and I do not need the extra room that the MDX has. Mileage is ok, been getting an overall average of 19 mpg, this should improve after a couple thousand miles. I was concerned about going to a 4 cylinder from my 06 TL. This vehicle has plenty pickup and absolutely no turbo lag. The engine is rather quiet too from the inside, as opposed to how noisy it is on the TSX. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tech package is a must! Nav package is great and back-up camera works pretty well. Sound system is great! I recommend getting the auto dimming mirror, rear area rubber tray and the rear bumper appliqu to help prevent scratches from the bumper when loading/unloading.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving a large SUV for the last four years, I am thrilled to be behind the wheel of a new RDX! I am thoroughly enjoying the superb handling as well as all of the amenities that come standard and those that are part of the tech package. For the extra cost, the navigation and voice command functions are easy to grasp and make the entire driving experience even more exciting. As a father who runs many errands with my son, I am pleased with the size of the RDX as it has plenty of interior room and is comfortable for back seat adults as well. Thus far, there is nothing about the RDX that I do not like. Definitely a welcomed change!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling is outstanding as is the sound system with the tech package. One touch voice commands make changing the climate and XM radio stations easy. All of the features combine to make each trip, no matter the length, exciting. Driving is no longer a chore, it is a pleasure. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car 4 months ago and love it! Quality materials and construction inside and out. This car feels more luxurious than many of the higher priced cars I drove and has so many more features when you add the Tech Package (totally worth the added expense, especially if you spend a lot of time on the road). I use the Bluetooth, the voice commands, and the Navi-traffic on every trip. Gas mileage could be better. My overall MPG (for 6000 miles) is 22.5. Not great when I compare it to my old Honda CRV, but is still better than I expected. To sum it up, if gas mileage is your primary concern, stick with the CRV or go to a sedan. Otherwise, you really can't go wrong with the RDX.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove home with the RDX w/Tech a few days ago and am absolutely loving this vehicle. The common complaints are gas mileage and bumpy ride but those are VERY easy to overlook with all of the other great features of this vehicle. The ride isn't THAT bumpy, but it certainly is a little rough. Freeway driving is very nice and I'm averaging about 18-19 on my first tank of gas with a good mix of city/frwy. My wife will probably get better MPG as she doesn't have a lead foot like I do. Overall, great value - tech package is amazing... best on the market (and I'm a geek) without question. Build quality is solid with a lot of little cool features.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tech package without question - voice command is spot on, bluetooth with my Treo 700w works great. Fold down backseat and easy open trunk (can open with your pinky finger) are very nice for my wife. Price is very competetive - I was lucky to get fleet pricing so great deal for me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was so hesitant to look at the RDX after I read all of the reviews about it being too bumpy of a ride with lots of wind noise. Coming from a truck based sport utility, this car screams luxury and comfort. The console is amazing and offers every amenity you can think of plus all of the gee-whiz gadgetry that appeal to the 30-something market. The stereo system is the best out there as well as the navigation package. The car handles the road like a sports car and fields the bumps just fine with minimal wind noise. If you are looking for a pillowy ride to tote your kids around this isn?t it. You just need to drive it for yourself to find out if it is a fit for you and your family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Crossover SUV is a blast to drive. I think its the best value in its class. This was designed to compete with BMW's X3 and does so quite nicely. Similarly equipped you would have to spend about $8,000 more if you opted for the BMW. The Acura has a well crafted interior that is is full of luxury. The handling is extremely sporty, it drives a lot like a sedan with all the great features of having a SUV. I have noticed some negative reviews regarding gas mileage, feeling bumps etc... It seems to me those people don't have common sense. If you want a crossover with sports car like handling and performance, you will give up some gas mileage and cushyness on the road. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Honestly, I was never even considering a Japanese SUV until I took the RDX for a test spin. I love the zero to 60 in 6.8 secs, SH-AWD (it truly works!), no-lag turbo. The RDX V4 Turbo is as good as any V6 guzzler SUV you see in the market, even better in some sense. And not to mention, the tech features are just fabulous. Everything works great. The RDX handles way better than BMW X3. And come on, the luxury and reliability of Acura can never be beat. The pricing is too good as well. And the best thing, the car is going to tell me when it needs servicing. Until then, I dont even need to take it to the service guys. How cool is that?! Go Acura!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo with no lag - handles like a car. SH-AWD handling in winding hilly roads of California. Acura Navigation Link System. The 5.1 Channel Surround DVD-A System. High reliability. It has the best luxury to price to pride-of-ownership ratio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a young single male who works hard and plays hard. From what I have read that was the market segment Acura was hoping to target. They definitely hit the nail on the head with the RDX. This car fits my lifestyle perfectly. Whether it's a night out on the town with friends, a business luncheon, or a snowboarding trip up north, the RDX handles all of my needs flawlessly. I was concerned about how fun it would be to drive since I was coming from a sports car, but boy was I wrong. This car is such a treat to drive, it doesn't matter where you are going. It's fun, comfortable, and has great features. This is one of the first cars I have owned that doesn't have a single rattle or squeak.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>You simply must get the technology package. I cannot fathom owning the RDX without it. One of my favorite features is the voice activation. Everything on this car becomes voice activated with the tech package! My friends still cannot get over it. I also love the audio system. It's one of the best!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Plain super, I love the vehicle. I was contemplating between fully loaded RAV4 and BMW X3. I am glad that I test drove RDX, within minutes I was certain that I was going to buy RDX. Turbo engine gives great accelaration, which I like better than v6 of RAV4. You get a feel of road while driving this suv which is very much like x3. RDX definitely score big points on style (interior and exterior). I have driven this car in lots of snow and icy conditions, Acura's SH AWD and Vehicle Stability Assistant provides super handling. I love driving this so much that I kinda want to be on road all the time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned the RDX for a month now and I still can't wait to drive it - I look for excuses. It handles magnificently and the turbo provides impressive power. Interior fit and finish is top notch and the seats are comfortable. When cruising at 80 it feels like you're doing 50 because it is so quiet and refined (the 4-cyl is only tach'ing 2800 at 80mph). Great handling and cornering as well with a ride that makes you feel in control. Driven it in two snowstorms and the SH-AWD & VSA performed excellently, keeping the car straight and in control.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my RDX this week, the day before a large winter storm hit our area. I thought the vehicle performed very well on the icy, snowy roads. The roads are dry today, and I love the handling and feel. The turbo engine has a lot of pep. The interior and exterior are very sharp. I've gotten lots of compliments already from admirers who've noticed the vehicle. I also love all the things that Acura has made standard on the RDX that are options in vehicles from other automakers. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend this vehicle to anyone interested in a smaller SUV that drives more like a sportscar.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this for a week now and I could not be more impressed with this car. I traded my 2002 TL and can't believe how much better the RDX handles. Acceleration is great for a two ton auto. The fit and finish of the interior is second-to-none with a smartly designed cockpit and great seats. I got the tech package and the ELS sound system rocks! Nav is easy to use, handsfree bluetooth works like a charm. I have read many reviews from others complaining about the gas mileage. I am averaging 17.5 after 600 miles of mixed driving. If you are constantly stomping on the gas (and jamming on your brakes) you'll get 12 mpg. You only need to feather the gas pedal and the turbo will move you!</TEXT>

Anyway, this one has much better mpg, fun to drive, great looks, fairly easy entry/exit for "fat" mama. Wish it had the power lift gate, auto on headlights (my Pontiac did).

<TEXT>I have a BMW 323i and love it. I bought a lexus 330 3 years back b/c BMW does not do well in snow :) Lexus is a smooth car but NO excitment to drive.. I was looking for a car w/ good in the snow, comfortable to drive long distance, fun to drive, can hold 4 people comfortably, good cargo area - the RDX fit the bill for all these. Being a female, I find most of the SUVs are TOO big and too heavy for me. This car feels like a sports sedan, except that it is taller and wider. The turbo give you the 'peep' of sporty ride. Yes there is more driving noise then a Lexus, but it's a trade off for performance.</TEXT>

The interior has the feel of a sports car and the turning radius is awesome. Safety was a big deal for me and the RDX has almost everything you could ask for in security at an affordable price. This is my second Acura and it is every bit as impressive as the first. There is also much to be said about the way Acura cares for their customers. I'm an Acura customer for life.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My car is my office as I put a lot of miles on my car. The RDX sold me on several points: 1) its outward style; 2) its interior design; 3) the Technology Package (outstanding audio and navigational system!); 4) the quality, fit, and finish of the interior materials; 5) the comfortable driver's seat; 6) its handling and performance; 7) the excellent warranty; 8) and Acura's reputation for building excellent cars and providing great service. The RDX has been very fun to drive thus far. Some might say that it drives too harsh; however, I am more than willing to sacrifice a little cushiness for the excellent handling and road feel the RDX provides. Additionally, this car really turns heads! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Technology Package is excellent. The sound system is fantastic!
