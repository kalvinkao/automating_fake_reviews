<TEXT>Short review.... I get 26.5 mpg overall mpg, posted seems low. And I go pretty fast. Bose stereo is a waste of money. Basic system is fine, and the OEM speakers they use are very good--even if you replace the head unit, stock speakers are solid. Seems Bose didn't tune the system because it rattles terribly. I'm an audio dood; Bose are clown shoes. A safety recall on engine mount, an "unofficial" recall on d-link in rear end, and a throttle failure in first year. Occasionally belches smoke. Hmm. Interior design is nice. Lots of rattles. Good cargo capacity. More fun than the WRX, feels faster, snappier brakes. Clutch is sticky and 'sudden'. Best 'fast' car for the money, by far</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the Fast most of all. Seats are nice, too--better than WRX. I can fit a huge sub cabinet or a half dozen trombones in the back, so the cargo capacity is really nice for a fast car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is the best in its class. I drove the Civic Si, Sentra SE-R spec-v, Acura RSX type S, Subaru WRX. The other cars don't even compare. The Mazdaspeed 3 is by far the fastest on the market. Looking to spend under $25k, I was shocked at the performance that I found with Mazdaspeed 3. 0-60 in 5.5 seconds... wow.. it's fast. Torque steer is not noticeable after you learn how to drive it. This car is absolutely fast and will blow away anything less than $60k in a street race (I know, I've done it). The bottom line is that this car is hot, has a very comfortable interior, has amazing power, great handling, great breaking and did I mention... it's FAST!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Speed... it's in the name. This car has way too much power. I wasn't expecting it during a test drive but it sent me home thinking "oh my god... that's too fast!"</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car used at 6,500 miles and have put about 9k on it myself. I must say that each and every single one of those miles have a smile attached to it! The car is very stable at highway speed and is quite capable of keeping up with much faster and more upscale sports cars. My daily commute to work is about 15 miles and I mostly do city driving. My driving style tends to be more on the spirited side of the spectrum. I love the exhaust note, the acceleration, braking and cornering! The build quality and workmanship is superior and the design is very modest but attractive. Driven modestly, this car will not attract attention, but if you have the devil's gas foot, watch out!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the second Mazda I have owned, and I cannot say enough good things about them. I cannot say I am a fan of paying 600 dollars for 18" tires, but I can say that I am a fan of enormous brake rotors, so it balances out. If you are looking for a bargain performance car, then you cannot beat this one. I was really looking for a wagon, which meant my options were this and the Subaru WRX. This car outperformed the WRX in acceleration and braking (I cannot say that I had a good test of handling on my test drives). The interior design on the WRX also could not compare with the Mazda. I love this car, and I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Even after 8 months I still can't really find anything that I don't love about this car. It's fast, and fun to drive while being economical and roomy. It's almost like being in a small suv size wise, but with the heart of a racer. All of my friends and family are impressed with it, and people in parking lots have stopped to ask me questions about it. My brother actually purchased his 2008 pearl white one yesterday. We now have a family of Mazda Speed3s. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. THIS is what sport- compacts are all about. The small size makes for easy parking, the interior is functional and has great space effiicency. the engine is always there, torque steer is minimal and easily controlled once you adjust to the car. The car needs very little from the manufacturer, and it comes with floor mats! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power band. The low torque peak with such a high peak number allows easy driving in any gear, even up hill at 70 mph with the cruise on, you'd never know it. Take a few twisty roads and learn how it pulls, how the body roll works, best FWD auto-x ever.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a long period of test driving cars I finally decided the Mazda was for me. It's just got everything I need and want. Plenty of room for all my stuff, good gas mileage and has plenty of power. Step on the gas and you feel an invisible wave of torque moving you along. Bottom end, top end, there's always plenty of power. The handling is extraordinary, probably handles as well as some rwd cars. Torque steer is alive but manageable. Keeping all the power in check are the powerful brakes, the steering is responsive and provides lots of feedback. All this performance and fun and still enough room for everything you own. This car is an amazing mixture of all you need.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power and the feeling of the turbo pushing you along. The way it handles with minimal understeer and roll. Controls all placed perfectly. GPS. The transmission thats slick with short and close throws. The way the car looks wheather moving fast or standing still while everyone admires it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned many performance cars:91MR2,02Miata,03WRX,05STI and this is closest to the STI for performance. I bought the car because I wanted a car that could be fast and practical, and this fits the bill perfectly. For a FWD car this has to be one of the best. Handling is fantastic and torque steer is perfectly manageable. The front diff pulls you into corners instead of pushing you out of them. The stability electronics are perfectly calibrated to handle the car?s power along with the limited slip diff. I can get from 19mpg city to over 30mpg highway. This car has a DISI engine (Direct Injection) that is very versatile, capable of delivering good power or MPG depending on how you drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DISI (Direct Injection) engine and Hitachi/Warner K04 turbo. Super Torsen Limited Slip Diff. Torque Management/TC/DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) most of the time its helpful in preventing unwanted wheel spin. 18? Wheels and tires are nice and perform very well. Aux audio input and 2nd jack for MP3.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is unbelievable. As of this review I have had the car for just over 1000 miles. I love the performance. The car handles great. One of the great parts of it is that if a regular mazda 3 hatchback or this car drives by you going fast, from a side view it is hard to tell the difference because there is no badging on the side. You will fool most people if you try to race them at a stoplight. The gear ratio is very nice. It's great when you can pass someone on the highway in top gear because of the turbo. There is not much turbo lag at all. The traction control works well. Remember that this car has 263hp so don't expect great fuel economy. I love the car I would recommend it to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine! Great brakes, nice 18" rims, nice sounding exhaust, good looking rear spoiler, pretty roomy interior, great all around car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned my 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 GT for a total of 45 minutes before I was in a head on collision by a RAV-4 going eastbound on a westbound lane on a major highway. We were both going approximately 65 MPH in opposite directions before we collided. I cannot comment on the long term reliability of the vehicle or the MPG but I am alive today due to the solid construction and safety features of this vehicle. Unfortunately the person driving the RAV-4 that hit me was not as lucky. My hat is off to Mazda for building such a fantastic and secure vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3000 miles, the biggest complaint is the interior rattles from everywhere. You get used to the power and begin to wish for things like a quieter ride, even more torque at the very low end, lighter steering, a smoother clutch uptake and shifter (or a cooler DSG like the VW). Gosh sounds like I should have gotten the GTI 4door except for the fear of the VW lemon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>From day one when I got this car my, I was amazed. I am a big fan of VWs, I have had the privileges of owning two GTIs and still have one of them (95 GTI VR6 with 180kmi). Was in the market for a new GTI but after reading the reviews of MS3 I had to test drive one, and I was hooked. The car is everything you read about, quick acceleration, handles great, HID headlights, navigation, rain sensing wipers, the list goes on. You get everything you pay for and then some. Other vehicles will easily have you closer to $30k for the same amenities and you still will not get 263 hp out of a 4cyl or some 6s.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo charged engine. Love the seats. Rain sensing wipers. Bose sound system. Aux input for MP3 player. Nice arm rest w/storage compartment. Nav. HID lights and how the hood scoop is integrated to the underside of the hood (Stealth). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the first Mazda I have ever purchased. This car has so much value, from the off-the-charts performance at this price point, to the interior styling, that I've become a hard core Mazda fan. I am an avid cyclist and golfer so the roominess of the hatchback was the initial attraction. I can safely highly recommend this vehicle to any consumer who needs the room for outdoor gear and family (or friends) but who also is a driving enthusiast. The only downside, some passengers might not be too keen on the sports suspension. The easy remedy is to allow them to drive, just once, and they'll be convinced it?s all worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Mostly used for commuting. The car is fun to drive and has a lot of go to it. It is a lot different than the WRX I used to own. Sometimes I miss the AWD but many times I notice myself smiling at how fun the Mazda is to drive and corner with. It feels small when you are driving, which is good, but when you turn your head and look at it you realize it is quite roomy with lots of cargo space. I love the hatchback look and the exterior styling. The braking is fantastic and the interior is much nicer than that of the WRX. In the end it is a hard comparison to make- each car has its pluses and its minuses. I am just keeping my fingers crossed that the speed is free from defects.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style (exterior and interior). Top end speed. On the highway this car has a great deal of power for passing and accelerating past cars. Room inside. There is a lot of space for cargo if needed. Wolf in sheep?s clothing. It basically looks like the average commuter but is far from it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently traded in my 2005 Mazda3S HB and got the Speed3 three days ago and this thing is unbelievable. It's totally a different animal than the regular 3. The turbo adds so much and the suspension is awesome. It corners like you're on rails and the stock Bridgestone Potenzas are way better than the stock Goodyears on the 3. The exhaust is much better too, it sounds mean. This car just begs to be driven fast and I got the red one so it's a cop magnet, but oh well. I think it's the only color to have with this car, it makes the black accents really pop big time. The MPG is about the same as the 3 too, which is awesome. If you are looking for a car in this class, go get an MS3!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the price, the car is amazing. Fun to drive, looks great and decent economy for the power it puts out. Shifter needs to guided through the gears (i.e., vague). I have driven many worse manual transmission cars. Don't let this aspect be a deterrent. Power comes on quickly around the 3K RPM mark. It's a rush when you nail the pedal, hang on to the wheel. Although the gearing is "close ratio", you can be comfortable leaving it in gear around town and not shifting much. The car has plenty of power to get moving even in low RPM ranges.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats: good comfort in this price range. Steering: very direct at all speeds, good feel. Space: the cabin has great head and legroom, with the seats down you can fit quite a bit. Engine: absolutely a gem.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went in to drive a Mazda3 wagon, but fell in love with this beautiful little car! It is a blast to drive, handles well, screams off the line, and doesn't drain the bank account too much. There are quite a few upgrades and mods available (since the MZR 2.3 is shared with a couple of different models), so go wild, if that is your thing! Please drive one before you make up your mind! You might be surprised. I was. Performance wise, the car goes. It is a front wheel drive car, so you will have some torque steer, but it is very minimal compared to other FWD with high horsepower and torque. The car sports great low-end torque for a turbo 4 cyl. All this under 25K!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Get-up. Fun to drive, but you don't stand out. Very comfortable seats and good driving position. Good visibility. Lots of room. A bunch less torque steer than I was expecting! Great handling. Solid looks. Low turbo-lag. I could go on and on about this little car. IT IS A GREAT BUY!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This thing is a blast to drive! The surge in power is incredible, and turbo power is progressive like a locomotive. It has tenacious grip, and the torque steer is under control.

<TEXT>I've only had mine for two weeks, not even getting past the "break-in" 600 miles yet, but I've pushed it a few times, and WOW. This car can barely be contained. It urges you forward and practically demands to be let loose. Got mine in black with tinted windows and it's a beast. It took me weeks to track down the one I wanted, but it was worth it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Speed obviously! Nothing like needing to move fast and being able to. I also love the design. Despite being a "wagon" I think it looks sleek and sexy. Well constructed interior and exterior. It's tightly built, handles the road and responds like a sports car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have put many happy miles on my still young speed 3. The car performs exceptionally well for the price. Interior surpases all in its class. Gas mileage is great for a turbocharged car if you can keep from using the Zoom pedal to the right. The shift feel was a problem but is easily fixed. The rumored tranny issues have since been quietly fixed. For ~25k + a few modifications for power = an excellent car that will send stock STI/Evo's in the dust and leave some BMW owners confused! The cable style shifter it is easily fixed with 20 bucks that will get you some shifter bushings (5 mins to install), synthetic tranny fluid, and an absolute must is a rear engine mount that is easy to switch out. The rear engine mount allows for less engine movement, better shifting and traction.</TEXT>

This car put a smile on my face that hasn't left in the 4 weeks I've owned it. The Speed 3 is just a lot of fun to drive. The car feels solid and very well built. The Grand Touring model has many amenities including rain sensing wipers, automatic headlights with height adjustment, great traction control, plenty of storage, and very nice styling lines. It is a bargain compared with it's competition and ranks higher in most comparison tests. 0 to 60 in 5.8 seconds and 155 mph top speed is accurate and among the best in class. Zoom zoom.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looks good, drives nicely, ample interior room, functional, and turbo makes you smile. But I have to say this car has too much torque and power and as a result you have a lot of torque steer and way too much understeer. Now 90% of people who drives this car will not be able to utilize the full 260bhp unless you are going in a straight line. Me... I prefer the curvy roads. The suspension is fairy stiff but when driving hard, not stiff enough. But when you're driving normally, it feels too stiff. All in all, great car but they didn't focus too much on handling because they focused too much on power only. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow...what a rush. That about sums it up. Great road feel--not too harsh of a ride (compared to other "sport-y" cars this fast) and quiet for this car segment--much quieter than my '01 Protégé. Interior features are very well thought out. I have the Touring, so the extra features like auto wipers and lights are wonderful--and make me almost think I'm in a more expensive car. The red stitching has been approved by everyone from 60 years old down to 10--good going Mazda on that feature. Torque steer is only noticeable when turning sharply in 1st and 2nd gear, after that it?s only a slight nudge that simply gives you a smile as you remember how much fun it is to lay on the lead foot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What can I say that has not already been said. The bottom line, it's great. For years I have owned GM muscle in LS1 powered Camaros. I guess I was naive to accept a turbo 4. Not that I don't like the LS1, but I feel like I have one again, just way more refined. The suspension is great, the clutch and shift pattern are very smooth and the torque curve is great for my wife to pull out in traffic. I am a born again Speed3 fan, it's great to go to the store and actually have a place to put food, and even luggage on vacations. And the best part, well I am still waiting to pull up beside a Mustang GT and have a little fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is great, Engine and suspension system is out of this world for a "Family Car". The interior is a great fit and very comfortable for a daily driver. Not to mention we have great room for luggage, a baby and torque. Its the Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of Cars. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It took me 3 weeks to locate a black GT. It was definitely worth the wait. This car is the most versatile car out there. Below 3000rpm it is about equal to a Mazda 3. Then the turbo kicks in. It is a rocket sled. The WRX is more expensive with less power. The cobalt is cheaper and looks and handles cheaper. The G35 is nice but too pricey. To put this much power into a front wheel drive and make it work is an engineering marvel. The interior design is slick as well, the suspension is tight, and I love the headlight beam adjustment control option. The Bose system is very nice, and there is the midi port for mp3 players as well. The hatchback feature also gives it a lot of cargo room</TEXT>

It delivers killer torque much like my previous 8 cylinder but handles like the much smaller performance machine it is. It also has tons of usable interior room. This is important to me because I run a small business and need to haul computer gear from time to time. It also accommodates my wife and kids in comfort. Build quality is impressive. The driving dynamic much closer to a European sport sedan than any other Japanese car I've ever been in. Nicest car I've ever owned for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very fast, yet easy to deal with as a daily driver. Very tight car, excellent build quality. Engine torque and acceleration. Stellar handling. Dispatches transitions precisely and quickly with almost no body lean. Great ergonomics. Good seats. Very good sound system. Xenon headlights. Styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Being very religious to the Honda and Toyota name I was very VERY skeptical about buying something whose parent company is Ford. After reading review after review of Mazdas in general getting raving reviews (especially the 3 never even having a recall!), I bit the bullet and purchased. The days are now long gone that I think only Honda and Toyota are the only makers that make a wonderful car...and I am not limited to very timid designing, looks, and performance! Love the car would recommend to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 6 speed is very precise, the rain-sensing wipers and auto lights are super convenient. The nav system is great (no more Mapquest! YES!) Fit and finish is excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had this car for a couple months now, and followed it for about 6 months before release. I had a 2004 Mazda3 fully loaded for 3 years before i traded it in for the Mazdaspeed3. Creature comforts + Performance + Style= Way more than $25k Great car for money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New exterior design and interior design from the regular Mazda3 to make it look nice. 18" rims, half-leather seats, so many options to list! Bose, HID, 6 speed transmission, 8 cupholders.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is primarily my wife's car and was purchased for its 5-door functionality and fun to drive quotient. In our fledgling 2 days with the car we are most impressed! The fit and finish is far beyond what we expected from a 25K wagonette. The handling and acceleration are, as expected, fantastic. The thing that really surprised me was how "tight" and quiet the car is. I expected a more uncompromising driving experience, but have thus far been rewarded with both performance and refinement. Bravo Mazda, well done!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Mazda really did their homework on this one. The fit and finish is excellent. I purchased the upscale model and am quite enamored with the bells and whistles (automatic climate control, headlights & windshield wipers, MP3 connection, etc.). The seats are very comfortable and adjustable. Love the BOSE system! Even my wife likes the comfort of the car. When the turbo kicks in, it reminds me of my Ducati with the throttle wide open. Six speed is nice, although regular 3's 5-speed shifts smoother. Clutch engages/disengages a little quick, but that makes for good power shifts. Cornering is quick and smooth. Ride doesn't wear you out. For the price, I don't think I could have done better!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is by far the best vehicle out there right now. Civic SI and VW GTI really have nothing on this car. Handling is unbelievable, when I get out of the car I'm all tensed up from the drive. Wonderful car for those that want performance and practicality. I bought black even though its difficult to take care of its by far the best available. I couldn't be more happy with the MS3 Can't wait for accessories. This really is the poor man's BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I won't repeat all the accolades from the earlier reviews. Trust me, it's all true. This is a car that you make up excuses to drive. The drive becomes the only thing that matters - the destination is irrelevant. I'm in my early 50's and haven't had this much fun with a vehicle since my Kawasaki 900 from many years back. That said, two things I'd like to point out. First, if you buy this car (and you should), get the windows tinted. It's the perfect finishing touch to the stealth look. Second, the Bose system is great but you'll have to be content with sound that comes "at you" rather than "surrounds" you. That's in part because they can't put the sub woofer in the back. Pity.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Absolutely everything, from the color (True Red) to the wheels to the seats to the fact that it's not shaped like a "wedge" (like everything else seems to be these days). This is the closest thing you'll find to automotive perfection under $50,000.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After years of expensive repairs on Audi's and BMW's I went Japanese, with no regrets. The build quality and materials are almost equal and the price is considerably less. I expect maintenance and repairs to be much less. This car is the perfect balance between economy and performance. I almost bought the base model, but for a little extra you double the performance (literally). I'm not a racer, but it's nice to know your car will stop quicker than almost anything out there (larger brakes), handles wonderfully for accident avoidance or fun (tighter suspension, extra supports), and when you need to pass on the highway is faster than a Porsche (or anything under $75k).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I've loved the design of the hatch for years, and the interior is excellent. Best seats I've ever ridden in (including BMW and Audi). Simple dash/instrument design. I love the Bose audio, and don't find bass lacking. Excellent visibility, outstanding build quality. Great 6-speed which I found very smooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had the car for about two weeks and have driven it 800 super fun miles. It is a true pocket rocket in all sense of the word, yet it has four doors, large luggage capacity, super tight suspension, a turbo that is willing to please and best of all it is affordable. This car truly is fun to drive especially in windy roads. The car handles almost as good as my mid-engine MR2. The oversteer is present as I expected with the 263 hp front wheel, but it is manageable. The shifting gets some getting used to, truly awkward, but you tend to forget about it when the turbo kicks in. This car also feels at home in city driving as it is very nimble and responsive and fairly easy to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Horsepower and sports car suspension. 5 passengers, aggressive stance, great exhaust tone, affordable price, large luggage capacity and a family pleaser. I can't wait for the Mazdaspeed upgrade which will boast it another 35 hp. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is wonderful. Practical, decent mileage (getting 30mpg highway). I put over 1,000 miles on with a smile. It goes like stink, great handling, very comfortable, great stereo Bose, Recaro like seats, nice fit and finish, flies below the radar - great stealth. The faster it goes the faster it goes. This car is more of a competitor to cars that cost $10G more - seriously think bargain A3 with S package. Can't wait to get it out to a road course. This car does more things well than anything else I've ever driven. I can have a family car, sports car, haul stuff home from Lowes and afford the gas to get to work every day (60+ miles daily). And, I know I will enjoy HPDE, Track days!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>VALUE. Handling, 267hp/280tq comfort, refinement, and I can get my wife and 3 kids in it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Given that I'm still within the break-in period (600 miles per Mazda), it's easy to feel the cars power at low rpms. My silver MS3 looks better in person than what I could imagine from the photos. The sport seat height and lumbar adjustments, along with the telescoping / tilt steering wheel provide a perfect driving position. Visibility is very good. The exhaust is louder than I expected, but it fits this sports car. If you're into bargain priced speed, 4 doors, practicality and quality, this is it. Competitors? WRX- ugly & fewer features. GTI- poor quality. Civic Si- poor torque & needs high rpms. Accord 6 speed- wait a year for the re-design, but it costs more. Lexus 250- $$ and too slow. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The driving experience: position, sport seat, view, handling, torque, sound and 6 speed shifter. Good looks and unique 18" wheels. Roomy rear seats; very good leg and head room. Bargain price for features & performance. Four doors. Doesn't look like a boys car, e.g. WRX STI and EVO. Built in Japan.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Previous to owning this I had a '06 Mazda 3s 5-door that I picked up in August of '05. I loved that car; the handling was great, acceleration was more than adequate, styling, IMHO, far and away the best in its class. But when the opportunity presented itself to get a Speed3, I jumped at it. This is a ridiculously well-engineered car for the money. I ended up with a Cosmic Blue GT (6-disc changer, Xenon, Bose System, etc.). The turbo kicks in around around 3K RPM and just hang on when it does. What really impresses me about this car is how docile it is around town. Easy to drive and very relaxed until you drop your right foot. Then it's on. Very happy with this one...it's a keeper.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>263 HP with a 6-speed manual. Upgraded suspension. New front end.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just picked my Speed3 up this morning. Having windows tinted now and can't wait to get back in. Read all the hype and was skeptical. Well, after jumping through some hoops to get the dealership let me drive it, it's a amazing little car. Torque and understeer are present, but nowhere near unacceptable levels. Goes in turns hard and holds line very well. Heard some knocks on the transmission, but I think it's smooth and responsive. Now we'll just have to see what the gas mileage is like because it's going to be hard to hold off the throttle in this rocket. Heard MazdaSpeed is coming out with a tuner kit that will add about 35 horse...wow! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the exterior and interior styling. Seats provide very good lateral support. Stereo seems powerful enough. Never pictured myself driving a blue car, but Cosmic Blue is way cool. Easily will fly under the radar! Exhaust note is pretty sweet too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We drove our Mazdaspeed3 over 280 glorious miles of smiles home from the dealer, and loved every minute in our sweet, hot hatch! With the smooth powerful acceleration, superb handling, and surprisingly pleasant & quiet ride we ran out of highway long before we wanted too. Varying speed / RPM's all the way, we still got 25.52 MPG on the first tank of gas. Everyt ime I think about this car, (often, I confess), I just want to get the keys and "Zoom Zoom"! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, performance, handling, ride, seat comfort / interior, build quality, the pure pleasure of driving this, and the rarity (you won't see many of these with just 5,000 available in the USA). This is easily the most fun car I've ever owned (and I'm 57!).</FAVORITE>
