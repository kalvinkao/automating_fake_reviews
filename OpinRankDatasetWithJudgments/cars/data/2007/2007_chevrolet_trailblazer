<TEXT>I love my ss.. It reminds me when I was 16 drivin my '56 belair. Just a bit faster & a lot more comfort, easier to steer and obviously more features. At 24k I had to replace the front brakes $450 wow! That was for brakes & turning rotors. It also needs 4 new tires $600+. At 54 years old, I can say I have always driven a Chevy. Even though I love this ss, I'm getting rid of it. It's time 4 a change. I don't mind the 9 mpg around town on 93 octane ($2.85 gal. Now) but the upkeep is too expensive and I'm used to replacing brakes & tires at 50k or 60k, not 24k. I hate 2 say it, but I'm buying a Toyota. Better quailty, better engineering. Sorry gm, you can't make they quality anymore.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Trailblazer for about 2 years and already I've had it in the shop 2 times about to be the 3rd time. Twice with the ignition and once with the passenger side window not raising. I'm very disappointed in the lack of quality in this problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive my Trailblazer mostly in town. After switching over to a synthetic oil I improved MPG's from 15.5 to 16.5. I had some front end trouble at 38000 miles. The entire rack and pinion steering system had to be replaced. $1500.00 ouch! It's a good SUV. Currently I have 47000 miles on it and no more trouble. </TEXT>

<TEXT>In Sept. 2007, I traded in a Ford Taurus SES for a 3LT Trailblazer with the 5.3L V8. I drove the SS, and even though the acceleration and handling were impressive, the fuel consumption made me rethink. I then drove a 4.2L I6, but just after driving the SS, it seemed lacking. As the 5.3L gets the same mileage as the 4.2, I went on the look for one. Not a lot more power than the 4.2, but a lot more torque makes for effortless acceleration and quiet cruising. A highway trip today yielded 24.6 mpg with the cruise control set 4 mph over the limit. rides smooth, seats are comfy, and you can beat Lexus LX 470's and GX 470's all day long, as there are no external V8 identification badges.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think Chevy should have kept this truck in production. The Atlas 4.2 inline six has lots of power 291 HP.It pulls our 24' travel trailer with ease. It is so smooth running the factory set up the ignition so that you can not engage the starter while the engine is running.Not that you would want to! The leather 8 way PWR heated seats are great.As is the rest of the toys this truck has.I think the average fuel consumption at 9.0L/100km is good. Best I have got was 8.2L/100km.I had a 1996 GMC SLT AWD Jimmy that had a 4.3 V6 and 190 HP.This is by far a better truck in all areas. I would buy another Trailblazer LT but maybe if fuel cost was not a concern I,d jump at the SS Trailblazer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My fiance and I purchased our TrailBlazer as a third vehicle for road trips to visit family in the north east. Gas mileage isn't stellar, but for the type of vehicle it is, I think it's fine. Interior is basic, but that's exactly what we wanted - and it fits the price. The exterior is very Chevrolet and brawny. The tight turning radius is extremely welcomed in the congested traffic we have in DC. The ride is great for a BOF SUV and it feels nimble and brakes adequately for it's size. Acceleration is fine, but at times it feels as though it could use some more power. I guess I'm spoiled as my daily driver is a 2005 GTO. Overall, the vehicle is perfect for our needs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The turning radius is EXCELLENT for the size. The styling is great and it's very confident in snow and ice, even when left in 2wd.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ok, go out there and try to find something like this for the money, good luck! This is a very fast truck, accelerates, sounds, handles and drives like a sports car. I bought it used, 13k miles, one owner, fully loaded, paid 24k, could not be happier. Drive as a company car, need all the room to put all my stuff, puts a big smile in my face every time I press the gas pedal. OK gas mileage stinks, what can you expect? 6.0 liters, 395HP/405Lb torque (you will feel them) you need a lot of gas to put out those numbers, I get 13MPG average, which is comparable to a lot of V8 trucks out there. If it snows where you are get AWD and get grippier tires than the OEM Goodyears</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really like the vehicle and it's very comfortable. When my spouse and daughter get into the car they love to fall asleep because the leather seating is so comfortable. My coworkers do the same thing. I do not like that the battery drains quickly when I leave the vehicle sitting in the parking lot over 3 days.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've always been a Chevy fan. But after a few purchases in the 1980's and 1990's I felt the build quality had went downhill so much I was wary of buying another Chevrolet product. I am no longer wary of the Chevrolet brand. Since buying this 2007 TrailBlazer well over a year ago I have nothing but praise for it. No problems what so ever. Build quality is outstanding. The ride and handling are great. The acceleration is wonderful. Highly recomended!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle new in the fall of 07 as a left over. I put about 40K miles on a truck per year. I have been impressed with the power and fuel economy of the inline 6. I have had less than stellar reviews for the fit and finish and the vehicle locks. The interior console is poorly designed. I hate the OnStar big brother thing and the original tires. I now have a passenger side window track that is broke and I'm out of warranty in 13 mos. I'll probably keep this car for a long time but I get the feeling that its going to be expensive. If the American auto manufacturers are going to make it they are going to have to pay attention to details & stop worrying about gimmicks </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is by far the best SUV my wife and I have ever driven or ridden in. The ride is as smooth as can be, the handling is amazing, the looks are awesome, and we get 20 mpg which is great for an SUV of its size. It has lots of leg room, as well as a lot of luggage space. It gets up and goes great! The safety features are first class. We have put quite a bit of mileage on it and changing the oil is really the only maintenance it has needed. Great vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned two TrailBlazers and both provided great ownership. This latest vehicle is an LT model (the previous one was an LS) and we really like the added features. We have leather and a sunroof, and the 17-inch wheels. The color is Moondust metallic and is really a nice color (doesn't show the dirt as much). We also have the OnStar and XM radio options which are wonderful. This vehicle provides a nice ride and good utility with the rear seats down. I avg. about 18.2 MPG in town and 19.9 MPG on the h'way. at 70 MPH (higher MPH the MPG decreases). For an SUV this size and comfort I don't consider that too bad. I have regular maintenace done and have had no issues with both TrailBlazers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Really enjoy the leather and sunroof as well as the XM radio. The 4-wheel drive feature is easy and convenient to use. I find it quite comfortable for long trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was going to buy a Corvette, and have a second vehicle for a daily driver. That was all until I drove my 3/SS TrailBlazer. I have driven many rental car regular TrailBlazers, and the difference is amazing. You wouldn't think you're in the same manufacturer's vehicle. Word of advice, if you buy one, do not put a straight pipe on it, way way too loud. Gas mileage stinks, but its a 6.0 V8. It's very fun to drive on the twisties, but not as fast as I initially thought. Can't beat a Mustang GT, or a Z28, however it does accelerate hard, and shifts very hard - I really like that part. Beat a 350Z, and any other SUV with the exception of the Jeep Grand Chrokee SRT8, and Cayenne Turbo. Overall, I absolutely LOVE it! Can't complain.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats - suede and leather. Little badging on the exterior. Gets plenty of looks. Good acceleration, just not up to par with V8 sports cars.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for something practical, then I test drove the TrailBlazer SS. I forgot all about gas mileage when I put my foot on the gas, come 395 hp in a SUV, Corvette base block engine, Chevy you went to far. The interior a little sporty for a 51 year old, I think not. This vehicle still turns head a 21/2 years old. The Bose sound system is awesome, it handles like a sports car, but with enough comfort to make a trip through the mountains fun. Who knew radio (XM) could sound so good, I just purchased 3 years so I would always have it. Overall my TrailBlazer SS is a bunch of fun, although an ave. of 13 mpg in the city is tough. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second TrailBlazer. I loved my 2004 so much when it came time to trade in I just had to get another even after shopping around to other trucks. This is a reliable well built truck that is as comfortable as can be and still is capable of off roading here in Utah with ease. Perfect amount of space and great easy to use features and reliability. I have never had to have either of my trucks serviced for anything except the basic upkeep.

She wanted a sunroof and such. I wanted a Vette so we met about half way. The power is great. The gas mileage is not as bad as I thought. The first tank was on a trip over trailridge and back was 19.5 this is at 10,500 feet over sea level. It did not know we were on a hill. All the power you could use.</TEXT>

The fuel economy is pretty poor but what do you expect for an SUV with a Corvette based engine. The engine has a nice rumble to it. I've always had vehicles with leather but opted for the cloth on this one and I couldn't be happier. The seats are actually more comfortable than the leather.

So far I'm impressed by its performance and handling. The ride is solid and firm at the same time smooth. With a few things modded, this SUV will really wake up.

<TEXT>I have loved the TrailBlazer look since it came out, but never wanted to pay $30k for an inline 6cyl. Problem solved! I have been a Vette owner and this is a four door cargo carrying Vette. It rides great, handling is amazing, braking is very impressive, and it's just the right size for this kind of power. The clean exterior with little badging is such a tasteful look. I got a 2007 fully loaded minus nav for just over $30k and the 6001 lb gvwr makes it a nice tax deduction. I know the mileage is bad but that's not why you are buying this vehicle. Buy one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After much debate, I finally purchased the '07 TrailBlazer SS. Didn't get a lot of the frills, bought mostly for performance and I absolutely love the power and exterior looks. Not too crazy about the interior dash and the standard radio. Would definitely suggest at least getting the upgraded Bose sound system. The fuel economy isn't that great which seems to get less than my 02 Infiniti QX4 rated with the same mpg of 15 city and 19 hwy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new 2007 TrailBlazer. I had a 2002 TrailBlazer and just traded it in on the '07. It's loaded. The comfort level is most awesome. I will never own a different type of SUV. It's just pure sweetness. Thank you Chevy for making such a fine ride. I find myself wanting to ride in it all day long.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This one is fun to drive and very quick. The 6.0 has more than enough power. The interior is well done but there are some cheap plastics on the doors and dash. The rubber trim on the exterior winshield had to be glued back on after an 80 mph cruise. Overall much more satifying than my 2005 EB Explorer. I recently took a 400 mile trip (all on the interstate)and averaged 17.2 mpg at 75mph. The same trip in the 4.0 liter Explorer averaged 19.5.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle handles great! It also has all the power you would need with the 400hp Corvette engine. The sunroof did leak, but the dealership repaired it for me. The only downfall is that it gets bad gas mileage at 17 on the highway with the Corvette getting 27 on the highway. Overall I would have to say this is a great vehicle though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this truck. It is very comfortable, steers and handles beautifully. Feels like a luxury vehicle but with towing and 4 x 4. All the safety features like OnStar and side air curtains are a comfort. And it looks real good. I rode in back seat recently and love the rear seat heater with upper and lower choices and fan speed. Did I say I love this truck? Am looking forward to driving this for many miles!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got my SS just the other day. I went from a C320 Benz to this SUV and it is awesome! From the 20' wheels to its power. I found myself going from leather to cloth and I enjoy it a lot more than I thought. This is the first SUV I have owned and I don't think that I will go after another car again from owning the SS. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The comfort of my TrailbBlazer is one in a million. The sunroof is large and the heated leather seats are so welcome on a cold morning. The TrailBlazer rides beautifully and handles going into parking spaces easier then a smaller car. The memory seats have been great for me, as I let my spouse drive it on weekends. After driving this vehicle, I would not go back to driving a car again. I love my Trailblazer LT!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I know that it is too soon to make any long term judgement but the TrailBlazer we bought exceeds our expectations. When researching vehicles we consistantly read that the suspension of the TB was less than 'good' which kept us from considering the TB. We had a relative who drove an '06 and they said that they were pleased with the ride and handling. We got the LT (loaded) and so far can't drive it enough. Incidently, we also drove the SS. If it had not looked too 'pretentious' for a couple of 50+ it was tempting.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ease of driving/parking and the ride. The interior/ exterior is solid but not gaudy or flashy. The polished 18' wheels are worth the extra expense.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall I think that the SS is a good value for the money. I went from an '04 VW Touareg with almost every option stickering at $52 to the TB SS that stickered for $42 and after rebates and supplier discount picked the truck up for $30K. A lot quicker, believe it or not, better gas mileage and don't have the typical "VW Annoyances" like electrical problems and poor craftsmanship that they charge top dollar for and look at you funny when you complain about it. Seats are fairly comfortable on long trips, maybe adjustable headrests for us taller folk. Fuel economy isnt the greatest, but what "sports car" is? Overall its a tight feeling and riding vehicle, would recommend for an "everyday" car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I meet with a lot of clients around town, love the NAV, but could use some more UMPH. Quick, tight steering, fast and overall I feel safe in it, like I am in control of the vehicle at all times unlike a lot of other SUVs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had an '03 TrailBlazer LT. The first year, I swore I'd never own another. The next 2 1/2 years it was very reliable, enough so that when my saleman called me with a deal that was too good to refuse, I went for a fully loaded LT with leather, sunroof, heated seats. Subtle interior changes make it seem a lot classier than the '03. The only exterior change is a restyled grille, and a lower hangover on the rear bumper, so you can't see the spare tire. If this one is as reliable as the last one (after the first year) I'll be driving this well over 100k.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm really enjoying my TrailBlazer SS. If you have owned a previous TrailBlazer, I promise your experience was nothing like the SS. It looks, rides and drives like a totally different vehicle. I drive mine daily, and hate when I have to get out. Fuel economy is about like that of a 1/2 ton truck and the power is awesome.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is simply the finest SUV I have had. I am a big guy at 6?-5? and over 300#. I fit fine and this thing is fast! I mean we are talking an SUV here folks but it gets down and goes. I have always had SUV?s or Trucks and my last was a 450+hp supercharged Avalanche. This is so much more fun. The suspension is tight and very predictable. If you want one, get one. I needed one. I got mine and you can?t have it. Enjoy </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had mine for five months, but I've been tracking the production of the SS since its days on the drawing board. Working in a Chevy dealership makes me a bit biased I guess, but this car is all I was hoping it would be. I love driving my car every day. The only drawbacks would be the fuel economy and the lack of a dual exhaust. Go out and buy one. It's a blast!</TEXT>
