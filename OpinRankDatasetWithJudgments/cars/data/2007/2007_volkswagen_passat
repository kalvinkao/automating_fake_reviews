<TEXT>I bought it new. First foreign car I have ever owned (grew up in Detroit) and it is by far the best car. Looks great. It is very quick and handles nice. No problems with car and it now has 48,000. I have been told by a mechanic friend the key to German cars is you must maintain them very well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to say that this is the worst car that I have ever owned. I traded my 1992 Saturn SL1 for this car. My Saturn was definitely a "no frills" car that was perfect for my needs, which at the time was reliable transportation to and from school and work. My husband wanted a larger sedan. Our VW ran great for the first 15000 miles, then it was in the shop constantly. The car stalled frequently, lost power steering, had all sorts of electrical problems. A recurring crack in the fuel line was the last straw and we traded it for a Saturn Vue. I know others who have had many electrical problems with these cars. They are pretty but not reliable. I will never buy a VW again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, I had to write just because several people mentioned interior squeaks in dash. YES, I had the same problem after a few miles and there is a simple fix. I purchased a can of silicone spray and using the spray tube simply lube all the seams around ctr console and wipe off excess. Can said safe for plastics and I had NO harmful effect to dash. Do this 2-3 X's a week apart and be sure to get all the seems, even where black sidewall next to your legs meets ctr console. No more dash noise and silicone smell will fade shortly. On a side note I got 58,000 on original tires but did have cupping/noise also. MPG awesome w/35- 36MPG on my commute common. Otherwise A++++ mechanically. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior finish, Overall Look & nice handling. to computer shutdown at 135 MPH and handles very well at high speed. (Typical of Austrian/German Autobahn designed cars, eh?)

<TEXT>07 Passat sedan recently purchased (20K), looks great, handles well, but is the creekiest car I have ever owned. The dealer tried twice to fix the unacceptable noises in and around the dash/glove box/console to no avail.Is this typical for the 2007 passat? The service department said I was "very particular" even though they acknowledged that there are "minor squeaks, which, by the way, are noticeable on even the smoothest of roads.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Long story short; I used to own a company and drove MB as a rule. Now things are very different so I still wanted German and went with a VW. The top part of the engine has been rebuilt twice as the timing chain broke twice. Now I was a LITTLE late on a couple oil changes; like 2k miles, not THAT big of a deal (for other cars). Now with 78k miles the car is starting to tick again and it is under 3 years old. Now I have driven a lot of miles but drive (slow) due to some points I drive the speed limit. Take off NORMAL, stop normal, no driving fast or racing. Also because funds are tight I need to get the most out of the gas. I average (for the past 8k miles) 23.7 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Passat in 01/08 as a 'Certified Pre-Owned' with 15k miles and have driven it 18k since then. After the test drive, I was hooked by the performance and feel of the 2.0T engine. Also, the build quality appeared very solid. For road trips with the family, we often leave the other car (SUV) at home and enjoy the ride in the Passat. Gas mileage can exceed 30 mpg highway, even when fully loaded. However, a concern and disappointment is the lack of reliability. AC failed at 22k. A temperature sensor almost left me stranded at 26k. At 32k, an ignition coil failure resulted in the need for a tow truck. The warranty and my dealership have kept me and my wallet 'sane' (for now).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the power delivery of the 2.0T engine. It works well with the six speed auto trans. This drivetrain is far ahead of many competitors and combines performance and frugality. Together with the sophisticated suspension and well sized breaks, the Passat is an attractive package for a family car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Squeaks, rattles and all sorts of problems! The rubber seals in the doors squeak, the dashs sounds like it is coming apart and numerous mechanical issues! Worse car I have ever owned. And, the dealer can not find the Moroney Act sticker for the car, which is required for every new or untitled car sold in the US. Keep getting the brush off. They also sold it as new, only to find out it had 4,530 miles on it already! Does anyone know who to contact to take legal action against the dealership and VW...clearly they have broken the law and it is punishable up to a $250,000 fine. I guess one positive is that is looks really nice when it is cleaned up!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our third Passat (first a 1993) and it is the best. The car feels like a much bigger and more expense automobile. No problems and only expense is the scheduled maintenance. I alternate between Plus and High Test gasoline and runs great. I was most impressed by the highway MPG. I always get between 31 and 32 MPG with one trip turning in 35. I would recommend changing the oil more often than VW recommends. 10,000 miles seems a little long.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The one I bought is NOT like the one I test drove. Mine drives like a boat, or more accurately, my grandmother's Caddie. This does NOT drive like previous Passats (I've owned three). I don't know what the rationale is, but it is NOT the car you've heard of; it's redesigned by VERY old folks. Do yourself a favor: get the BMW 328i for the same price. If you "must" have a VW, get the sports package. The next four years are going to be the most miserable driving years of my life. I plan to drive my wife's older car as much as possible.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This wagon justs keeps getting better and better every day. Mileage is up to 32 mpg on highway and getting better after 5K oil change. Get the Luxury 2 package to truly enjoy all the features. Wife loves the roominess, safety and overall luxuary feel. The 2.0 Turbo engine is amazing. I'm making up reasons just to go for a drive. Dollar for dollar, the Passat out classes, out performs, and gets better mpg than anything out there. This is a sleeper that needs to be considered before spending more on Audi/BMW/Volvo, or settling for less.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the 2007 Passat Wolfsburg edition and we love it. I take my time when purchasing vehicles and the price/quality of the Passat Wolfsburg just plain beat out the competition! German engineering made the difference. Plus, only 6000 Wolfsburg are going to be made which is nice. Compare this vehicle's options with the Japanese versions and they don't compare for the price. A great family sedan with nice features - if you can find one left, get it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my new Passat for almost a month now and I love it. This is my second VW, and it's so good to be back. It's a definite driver's car. It was not the fastest car I considered (G35x, A4, & 328XI) but this car was a lot more car for the money. The one that came closest was the smaller Audi A4 2.0T. If you can get over the lack of Quattro and lack of the 4 rings on the grill - buy a VW instead! Very German, handles great, roomier than the others, and the 2.0T engine is real tourquey and fun. Love the 6spd DSG transmission too. With the Sport mode, I'd pick it over a manual transmission any day, when factoring in practicality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2003 Passat was a great vehicle in every way. Its speed, handling, comfort, quality, reliability...every one was top notch. That's not to say that it was the fastest or most comfortable car ever, just that the car met or exceeded my desires in each of the categories. There was absolutely nothing about the 2003 that I disliked, but when I first sat in the 2007 model I knew it was only a matter of time. I'm extremely tall, and the Passats have been good tall-person vehicles for a long time. The 2007 model offers me even more legroom with no loss in headroom, and more thigh support from the driver's seat. That's a great combination for me. So far, the car's been bulletproof.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Tornado Red exterior. Seriously...I usually buy the least awful color for a car, but this time I actually got a color I wanted. More importantly, though, are roominess, comfort, ergonomics, performance (especially on the highway), and (finally!) decent storage layout throughout the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As an update to my previous review, we now have close to 10,000 miles on our '07 Passat wagon. Its gas mileage has decreased due to the installation of a bike rack on the roof. We're now averaging about 25 mpg, with mixed highway/urban/rural driving, which is still pretty good compared to all of the SUVs out there. I LOVE the interior of this car; its ergonomics are excellent and the heated base seats are awesome. There is no need for leather, IMHO. Power is abundant in the 2.0T engine. Floor it in S or Tiptronic modes and 60 comes VERY quickly. There is some torque steer, however. The handling is the one area where I could see an improvement- there is significant understeer, although the car feels composed at all speeds. My Passat has had no reliability issues.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The driver's seat with power lumbar and heaters. Tiptronic shifter (though a 6-speed manual option in the wagon would be nice). The good base sound system. This vehicle provides a good balance of ride and handling. It has an incredible powertrain. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had this car for over a week but so far I have nothing bad to say about it - I look forward to driving it! This is my third VW after owning two Jettas. My wife and I considered other cars but could not find another manufacturer that offers everything you get with VW. I couldn't be more pleased with our decision and can't believe we even considered another brand. We also own a 2003 Audi Avant. The Passat is very similar to our Audi wagon but includes some nice upgrades and features. The 2.0T engine is phenomenal and I can feel the responsiveness over our 1.8T. Keep in mind our Audi has Quattro which has a completely different driving experience.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine and exterior styling of this car cannot be beat. In my opinion there is not a better looking car in this price range on the road today. The understated luxury speaks volumes over the muscular cheesy American options or the hyper articulated Japanese cars.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned a 2000 Passat and absolutely hated it! The warranty only covered 24,000 miles, and the engine sludged. The service at the dealership was lousy. My wife decide she wanted a new car which is why I'm here again. VW Passat still has the same awful mess created in 2000, just a slicker version. Its reliability was terrible. I lost a lot of time taking it to dealer and getting a run around delay from VW USA. It looks nice but if you want a reliable CAR don't try a VW.</TEXT>

It is a driver's dream. Don't believe me? Go test drive one. As far as reliability, it's too early to say. But, on every other aspect I am SOLD. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I have the Sport #2 Package. It makes your Passat more luxurious and elegant than a BMW or Mercedes costing 10 to 15 thousand more. Oh, and the rear arm rest has a dogie door leading to the trunk so you can watch "Rover" in his pet carrier while you roll down the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned VWs for the past 10 years and I must say VW out did itself with the 2007 Passat. Although the interior is not as flashy as the Toyota Camry it is simply and functional and yet classy. The 2.0T engine with the automatic transmission gives you more than enough power when you need it. The electronic steering gives you stability and no steering jar even when driving over the roughest roads. It has a smooth ride and minimal wind noise. Its rear seat room is overwhelming when compared to previous year Passats and its 60/40 rear folding seats are a plus. The price ($27,300) compared to other competitors like Camry and Accord was in my opinion and value when comparing all of the features, like the sunroof and heated seats.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the car, I enjoy driving it, and I like the way it looks, but it has some problems. I had the entire a/c replaced twice and down here in South Florida it just extremely uncomfortable. Luckily it was all covered. the other problem was that the radio knobs started peeling, but once again it was completely covered. Also, some turbo lag that is noticeable, but I still like the performance. After all that, I still smile when I press that accelerator and turn that extremely responsive steering wheel. This is my second Volkswagen and it definitely won't be my last. It is safe, good looking, has great performance, and most importantly it is very reliable in every situation.</TEXT>

I don't think the 0 - 60 time is far off from my 2004 Maxima SE. The 6 speed automatic is smooth shifting and the Tiptronic transmission works better than most of the manual over automatic shifters out there. The fit and finish of the car is as good as anything out there. I got the leather package and xenon adaptive headlights. It is still early, but this is a really well built car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Passat is nothing like the old model's build or design. This is the best car I have ever owned. The engine is very strong and the six speed tranny shifts smart and gets the power to the ground. The near 4,000 lb. weight and 4Motion make it a very good snow car in Denver on stock all season tires. It is a much better value than a BMW or an Audi. The controls are great. Subarus may be a better value, but the build and handling are superior in the German made VW vs. the Indiana made Subaru. With a light foot I have been getting 19 -20 mpg in town and 27 -28 mpg highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The electronics in this vehicle stink! The sensor wipers only work when it is not raining. The steering wheel touch controls only work sometimes. The air bags light comes on for weeks at a time, then just goes off. The low tire pressure light comes on, even if you completely empty the tires, fill them up correctly, and even overfill them. Also, the folding back seat is poorly designed. My other car is a Volvo xc70. The guys in Germany should buy a Volvo and study it. I got the Passat, because I thought it would be weird to have two of the same car. What a mistake. I should have gotten two Volvos. The price was about the same.

With 200 hp, I average 24-27 mpg in mix driving (mostly city). The trip computer is awesome. If you're out for shopping for a compact to midsize SUV, you should look at the new Passat Wagon.

But what we have encountered is endless problems with the electronic systems and poor customer service from the manufacturers and dealers.

This is my first Volkswagen and I can't say that I am disappointed, it has been an adjustment to come from a BMW 330CI convertible to the Passat 3.6. I can say however, that I do enjoy the 280 HP engine and the Dynaudio sound system. The car is extremely quick off the line and easy to handle at high speeds. I have had to readjust to front wheel drive which is my only real complaint, the styling is beautiful and has a great European look. I do wish I had not made such a hasty decision and done a little more research before buying. I did get the entire premium/sport/navigation package.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a 2007 Passat Wagon 2.0T. This car replaced a 1999 Passat Wagon and is a significant upgrade over the previous models. The 2.0T engine has alleviated the lag that existed in the 1.8T that was standard in the 1999 version. In addition, the car has more leg room and storage which were lacking in the '99 model. This car is fun to drive and comfortable too when equipped with the luxury package. I also looked at the Volvo V70 but after test driving both, I decided the Passat was a better all around purchase. I hope the 2007 version will be as reliable as the 1999 we drove over 100,000 miles with only minor problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Though I love the performance and comfort of my 2007 Passat 2.0T Wagon with 6-speed, Luxury, Leather, and Bi- xenons, I have had it for four months and I cannot wait to get rid of it. The build quality is the worst that I could imagine, from broken welds in the roof to creaks, squeaks, and rattles throughout the dash and headliner. I had read that VW's quality was a little shaky, but I was not prepared for this level of poor quality. I think that I would have been better off looking for a used 1984 Hyundai Pony, at least might expectations would have been in line with the results and the price.</TEXT>

It has been quite a head-turner with lowered ride height and included 18" rims. It handles like a dream with lot's of power. So far great it has been getting great gas mileage, 26 - 29 mpg. The manual transmission was a must for me and I couldn't be happier with it. It is a smooth shifter through all 6 gears and accelerates with ease.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sport seats! They have a nice leather finish and are comfortable, with 12-way memory adjustments. I also love that the passenger's rear view mirror automatically adjusts to show the curb when the car is put in reverse. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle has superb acceleration for a 4-cylinder. The engine feels much more powerful than the rated 200hp. The electric motor driven power steering allows for one finger steering at parking speeds and German style road feel at high speeds. Compared to a Volvo V70 2.5T you get most of the features, similar size, better performance and a $10,000 lower price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was so excited to get the newly re-designed 2007 Passat Wagon! What a mistake! I have had this vehicle in the shop THREE times since I purchased it in March 2006. The Engine Malfunction lights keeps coming on and the dealership cannot find the problem, except to say that that there is an evaporator leak that they cannot fix it. The service manager also stated that they had several Passats that were doing this. Please don't think that the dealership will back you up on these problems; THEY WON"T...I wrote a letter to VW and they were unwilling to help me too. Volkswagen will NOT stand behind their vehicle. The brakes squeak, too. Do not buy this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is great on gas, even though premium fuel is required. It has great pick up with the turbo engine. The warranty is better than most American cars'. The Triptronic transmission was a blast.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I must say, I am BLOWN AWAY by the new Passat. The gas mileage on our brand new vehicle is impressive; over 28 mpg on my first commute (rural roads, interstate, city streets), and it should only get better. The power from the 2.0T motor is phenomenal, and shifts from the automatic are imperceptible. I thought I'd be using the Tiptronic a lot, but I can see myself just leaving it in "D"- it's that good. I can't see why anyone would need the 3.6 unless they're hauling a trailer. The cabin is quiet and VERY comfortable - the leatherette is practically indistinguishable from the real thing. The Passat 2.0T is just the ticket for families that want performance, safety, and room without the thirst of an SUV. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 2.0T drivetrain must be experienced to be believed. This vehicle has very comfortable seats with heat and lumbar support. It has great fuel economy. The stereo controls are very intuitive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>VW's '07 2.0T Passat Station wagon is a hoot. Powerful and agile, it longs for the Autobahn and no speed limit. It looks (and drives) like a much more expensive car. It comes loaded with standard features that might be money-making options and possesses a number of very avantgarde features, this Passat is worth a hard look/purchase. Even the low-end version comes replete with the safety, efficiency, comfort, and engineering features of a luxury vehicle. On the Interstate in MD I got 37 MPG on 87 fuel, with the air conditioning running. It is fast off the blocks with its Tiptronic transmission (with three modes: auto, sport, standard). I'm glad I bought mine - I'd buy a second Passat if I had a larger garage!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior design is comfortable and spacious. The powerful turbocharged 2 liter engine gets you out of trouble, yet sips fuel. This car is well assembled, there is not a squeak in the car. The attention to detail is pure Teutonic. This car is very safe, it has airbags everywhere, it has the best brakes I've ever had in a car, safety redundancies. The ride is great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our second Passat Wagon, out first was a 2001 GLS 5-speed. We had many of the same complaints as have been voiced here about the options available on the 2.0T, but we got a call from the dealership telling us we could get all the options we wanted with the new configuration! So we did. We got bi xenon headlights, memory electric seats, Homelink, etc. We have had it for almost three months and 4,000 miles and we love it. My suggestion to other Passat lovers, tell the dealer what you want! This is a great car. Basically, we have got a Audi A4 in VW clothing (or maybe a BMW 5er)! Oh yeah, we are getting about 34 MPG highway and 25 in town..</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, I have test driven about 6 manuals and automatics. It is tricky to shift the manual, perhaps with several weeks practice it will get better/easier? I am not real happy with the clutch action. The ride is OK at lower speeds in town, but it's too noisy and a bit hard/rough at highway speeds on rough and bumpy pavement. It has good acceleration. The steering lacks fluidity. This car is not lithe, it handles OK for a biggish car. It has nice workmanship, looks, and an easy to use stereo with fair sound (but it's covered by road noise too easily). There was a good review of the Passat in Motor Trend's latest new car mag, which is out now. "Excessive" road/tire noise that covers stereo etc. is not good! This is a better car than most in its class though. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks, acceleration, and roominess. It is good that VW and Audi, like Toyota, is working on making less toxic car interiors. I can tell it has less of that toxic and dangerous new car smell. It gets fairly good gas mileage. I believe that 27-28 mpg is possible in mixed driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a new VW Passat 3.6 4Motion Wagon about a month ago. It is a really good looking vehicle and a blast to drive. It has lots of power, a smooth delivery, is very comfortable, and its gas mileage is very reasonable for such a powerful vehicle. The brakes are excellent and I really like the turning Xenon lights, which point in the direction the car is turning at intermediate speeds. The interior is of the highest quality, luxurious, well fitting, and ergonomic. The Dynaudio stereo system provides excellent sound. The space in the rear seat is good, even for adults. I am delighted to have chosen this vehicle and enjoy driving it every day.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just completed a 600 mi. round trip to Crested Butte from Albuquerque in the new family wagon, including interstates, mountain passes, 2 lane roads, muddy dirt roads and even a few inches of snow. The '07 Passat Wagon was an all around pleasure for either driver or passenger. The ride is very comfortable, handling excellent with plenty of power (for me) on acceleration and the highways and hills. Excellent gas mileage as well; nearly 33 mpg highway. I opted for package #2, 17" wheels and Dynaudio. Wow -- the Dynaudio is well worth the $$$! After 6 months of ownership I have neglible complaints about the vehicle. A little higher sticker, but a fine step up from our '05 Passat Sedan. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Without a doubt, the Dynaudio sound is fantastic. XM Radio is a nice highway feature. Generally well-designed inside and out. The remote open and button-close tailgate makes life easier.

The car can fit two full size children car seats and a booster in it easily and it is good on gas. I have never had so much fun driving a car before this one. Not even the new Ford Mustang was this much fun. I now find excuses to drive the Passat. It handles like a dream and is very responsive to my style of driving. It has a smooth and quite ride and an outstanding sound system. The standard safety features with the addition of the rear side airbags add a sense of security. You feel totally protected from whatever could go wrong during your drive. I love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a 2004 Passat Wagon I was surprised to find some of the downgrades in the updated version. The dashboard materials screem General Motors-like, not-quasi luxury Euro car. The door pulls are hard plastic instead of kind of rubbery like before. The front seats are flat as pancakes offering no thigh support, so much for that five hour road trip. There's also no lateral support in the front seats. The seats and the long straight dash remind me more of a Buick than a VW. The new dash is very far away and high up making forward visibility poor.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The first thing that impresed me was the engine - it is small but quite powerful. One just has to push the accelerator pedal down to get most out of it. The acceleration is especially impressive with the gear in the sport mode - even from a zero start. I love the exterior design. Tthe same goes for the interior, with some reservation for the front seat ergonomics - they are comfortable but could be a bit more accomodating. To add a "fly to the ointment" - I already had to get the sensor switch in the passenger seat safety belt buckle replaced. The dealership experience has been very good so far. </TEXT>

They never seem to be able to fix anything right the first time. I'm going to sell this waste of money the first chance I get.

<TEXT>The 2007 Passat Wagon replaced my V8 Touareg. The wagon offers more space and utility than my Touareg did, while providing a much better driving experience. I'm averaging 29 mpg combined and about 34 mph hwy...roughly double what I got in the Touareg. This also turns heads more than the Touareg did new. Any stigma my wife thought she'd feel with a wagon is absolutely gone. She loves the style and realizes it's a smarter purchase than another SUV would've been. This is an Audi / Mercedes / BMW quality vehicle at a Chevy price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>By far the 2.0T engine. It has torque all over the place while it gets 30 mpg. This vehicle's handling is incredible, it feels like I'm driving a compact car.

Its fit and finish are top notch, its engine excellent, its stlying is sharp, and its ride is fun. Get the sport package for no other reason than the sport seats which are much better than the "comfort" seats. Also it has metal on dash instead of wood for a little more sporty appearance.

The keyless key-ignition, a no-lever emergency brake, and a hill- hugger extra clutch add to the attractiveness of this car.

The technician gently told me that perhaps I hit the brake and the gas at the same time and the computer, for safety, favored the brake and went into a low power mode.

<TEXT>The 2.0T is fun to drive but the automatic tranny is slow on take off and lacks throttle response. There are a couple of aggravating squeaks in the interior on rough roads but overall interior is very nice quality, just needs some tweaking. The tail lights are separating within the light fixture and resting on the inner part of the enclosure plastic. To fix, u must replacing the entire fixture. Lights look good but are poorly put together. AC is cold but fan is insufficient to blow/cool even the front of the car in adequate time.

<TEXT>I have 8 2007 Passats that I use as TaxiCabs. 3 engines and 4 transmissions have already gone. Granted, we put alot of miles on it, but the turbo engine just does not stand up. Computer requires multiple visits to the dealer for reflash and these cars are absolutely draining the company wallet. Ive always owned Audis and VW's and never had so much trouble. Absolute money pit. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has performed very well for me in the past year and a half. I average about 31 mpg on the highway and 26 mpg during mixed driving. There isn't another 4-cylinder in this price range that performs as well. VW recommends premium fuel, but I haven't had any problems running regular, midgrade, or premium. Also, oil changes are expensive due to synthetic oil requirement. I hope the car remains reliable over the years, as some studies show that VW's can have reliability issues.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine - good start up speed. Seats - drove from WI to WA (2000 mi) in 2.5 days and didn't have a sore butt. In my Grand Am, the seat starting becoming sore after about 300 miles. Large fuel tank - 500+ miles on highway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We owned a 2006 Passat Sedan - great car, never had a single issue; fun to drive, good gas mileage, loaded with good features - an Audi at 60% the price. We needed more utility, so we decided to purchase a Passat Wagon. This car is great. Loads of space, fold flat rear seats, automatic real lift gate, heated seats, sunroof....great audio system. What can I say, the same great ride and handling, good performance of the sedan...with a ton of utility space. The kicker...we are averaging 28.6 mpg over the last 5k miles. This wagon is getting better gas mileage that our 2006 Sedan....same engine, same transmission....maybe we're just driving it better, or maybe it's just a great wagon.</TEXT>

The warranty has been extensively used I had the complete ac replaced all the door switches replaced the shifter replaced the rear safety interlock replaced have had at least ten engine codes two pcv valves replaced reflashed the ecm twice updates they said, one battery, one alternator. The stereo replaced rear safety latches on center console replaced rear deck lid lock replaced one and more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this car in March of 2006. We now have 34K miles on the car. It has been towed to various VW dealers four times. Twice we were going 65 mph on the freeway and it stalled. We've had the entire A/C system replaced (that was fun, going up a hill, a grinding sound and tons of smoke and the car died), many belts have broken, various sensors have malfunctioned, electrical problems and I could go on. We had 2 other VWs previously and no problems. Thankfully our other car is a BMW which is night & day compared to the Passat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun car, has plenty of kick when you punch it, not my GTO, but hey. This is the first turbo car and VW that I've voluntarily bought, and it was worth it. We just drove back from the mother- in-law's, 489 miles. There was still over a quarter tank of gas left, that rocks! Couple design features I'm not crazy about, but later, fun car, great utility, kind of a rough ride for a larger car, but moves like a smaller car. Suspension is kind of mushy, no slaloms anytime soon. Sounds sweet with an aftermarket intake!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Passat used, 2007 model in 2008 and absolutely love it! It came with the sport package which really sets the car off with the 18? wheels/tires and lowered suspension. When I was shopping for a car in 2007, I settled for a Jetta Wolfsburg edition because of my finances at the time and could not afford the Passat I really wanted. A year after I bought my Jetta I saw the Passat 3.6 w/sport package on the used lot of my local VW dealership. After talking with the sales manager I finally got a price I could afford. When my coworkers ride in my car they tell me that they really like how the interior is laid out and how the car rides and the exterior looks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I came to the Passat from an A4 which was too small. The potential competitors were either too expensive etc. I think of the Passat as an A6 with a $15,000 rebate. No problems so far but I am concerned with the oil pump bolt that is a recognized failure item. I routinely get 28+mpg on highway at speeds that almost never get over 100. The acceleration from 65 or 70 to way too fast is right now with no drama. So far one of the better cars I have owned. The VAG reputation for for lack of long term reliability is a concern which is why it will be gone before the warranty is. From what I understand the Passat wagon is being killed off. If true, that is too bad.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 7th Passat, and 3rd of this "B6" series. I've had NO reliability issues with any. The 2007 Wolfsburg Editions are late model year production with packaged goodies including 2008 wheel style; they appear identical to a 2008 Komfort model. I paid just over $24,800--some $3K off sticker. You can't get this much European car for the money anywhere else. Make no mistake--unlike the Audi A4, this is NOT a sports sedan. Suspension settings and steering effort have been softened and seats "Americanized." However, it's a roomy family sedan with Euro flair and quality. Skip the thirsty VR6--the 2.0t engine is enough; it's happy with the 6 spd Aisin automatic, and plenty powerful off the line.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interiors, even in vinyl form, are way above the class average, and nicely done. The 2.0t engine is very powerful with little turbo lag that plagued the 1.8t. There are APR chip kits that give VR6 power with much better fuel economy. Great hwy mpg but city mpg isn't if you keep your foot down!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 03 Honda Accord for the Passat. Love the car except the premium fuel requirement. Recently oil pressure light comes on in between oil change (10,000 miles between as recommended by manual). Had car towed to dealership. They said car can consume 1 qt for every 1200 miles, and Volkswagen considers that normal? This sounds like a design flaw to me. My accord went 10,000 miles between changes and never lost a drop. I had it well into the 80K area. I am not satisfied with their response to this so far. I didn't win this car in a raffle, and want it to last without worry. Other problems is radio had display glitch and air bag on drivers side had to be replaced. Not happy at this time</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Passat in November 2006. I absolutely love it, but it has had multiple cosmetic problems. My biggest problem is that the leather seats have discolored, and I am getting no help from VW on resolving this issue. I've also had trouble with the Bluetooth (installed by the dealer after-market), and the Nav system had to be replaced after it got "stuck." Except for the purchase experience, I have had nothing but customer service trouble with two local dealerships (not the one I purchased it from) and VW Corporate. I love the car, but as soon as I am not upside-down in the note, I will sell it and get a Lexus, just because of the customer service.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this sedan after having a tree fell on top my week-old Passat Wagon. This car is super plush, super quick, and has every amenity I could possibly want. I actually chose this over a more expensive Mercedes C-class sport, which I found extremely sluggish and a lot smaller. For me, the Passat is like getting the Audi A4 engine with the A6 room...and saving about $20,000. One problem, though: the brakes are god-awful. They are spongy and way too small for the engine, which is extremely peppy--especially when accelerating between in the mid range. Going up hills, and accelerating at highway speed, the 2.0 turbo really hums. Love the stereo too.</TEXT>

This car is great in the snow with 4 snow tires...as good as quattro..yet it is FWD. The car drives amazing. Since I've owned it over 1 year and 21,000 miles, ive had to replace the low note horn and an oxygen sensor. The dealership is not the greatest, but there are plenty of places to go for service. I love this car, I get many compliments everywhere I go from people who are 18 to 70! It's a real head turner. I did the APR chip upgrade which boosts the HP to 257hp and the torque to 303lbs of torque.WOW! a Porsche in disguise! Go buy a Passat..you wont regret!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the 07' Passat wagon used in March with less than 10K miles and so far it is a real joy to drive. I too like many am experiencing some unpleasant squeaking in the dash area, but my local dealer assures me it can be fixed. Traded in a 4Runner and I have about the same amount of cargo space, it's actually longer than my wife's Grand Cherokee. If you are tired of getting beat up driving an SUV, this is a great alternative. Engine, while a little clunky sounding on the outside, is very smooth and responsive. The interior is gracefully simplistic with all of the controls intuitively placed. Although there will probably be a learning curve if you are a first time VW owner like myself</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car a year ago. First, I was very satisfied. This car looks and performs well for the money I paid. Since the purchase, I?ve been in the service at least 8 times; mostly minor things like lights and radio, but I also had a bigger concern: the oil level goes from max to min in 3K miles. At dealership, they changed some parts including turbo. Still, the problem was not resolved. It took me a year back and forth. Year later, they took a test after 645 miles and determine that 200 grams of oil are gone. They call to VW and after that called me and said that VW says that it is normal. I thought they were joking. They were not. </TEXT>

<TEXT>There is a solidity to this car that Japanese cars don't have. So far after 1.5 years no reliability problems. The 2.0T is efficient but allows for easy passing. We get 32 mpg on rural roads, though premium grade req'd. Another minor niggle is that 2.0T sounds "gravelly" compared to a most V-6,I-6 or even a smooth I-4, though it feels very smooth and unstressed for the most part. The suspension is ideal - not floaty but still supple. Road trips are very comfortable. Road noise is low to moderate. The seats are comfortable and leatherette (vinyl) is a good alternative if you don't want leather. Touches throughout that demonstrate very thorough engineering for everyday livability.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It was between a Subaru Legacy Wagon and this car. The Subaru 2.5 was not powerful enough and the 2.5T was too thirsty. So the remarkable 2.0T was really the deciding factor. Typical European ride is perfect. I personally find it more comfortable then extra oscillations of a soft, floaty ride. </FAVORITE>

Volkswagen really has the basics down. We have the 2.0T with the Sports Package which reminds me of the sorority girls I dated in college. They were fun to look at and knew how to have a good conversation, but the maintenance was crazy. Two hours to put on make-up, lots of shopping and were always a little too picky about what they ate. The VW is the same way... there is always something flashing or beeping, and it requires synthetic oil and the premium gas. Not worth the trouble for all the extras. Get the base model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle because I have a long commute and needed something comfortable. This car more than exceeds that. Wonderful performance out of the 4 cylinder while not compromising on gas mileage. I'm averaging about 25-26 mpg in mixed highway/city driving. I've taken sharp turns at 55 mph and have gotten it up to 135 on a long straight away. Interior does not feel cheap in anyway like "domestic" vehicles and standard options are more than enough. I have about 15,000 miles on it already and no problems at all. I can't recommend this car enough to anyone in the midsize sedan market. I mean why buy another vehicle w/6cyl that has less HP and eats more gas as is the case w/many others.</TEXT>

The windshield seems to scratch if anything gets on it. Plus, the car has developed annoying squeaks and rattles. At the 10k service, I'm going to have the dealer go over the car with a fine tooth comb to make sure everything is checked out. The dealer is fantastic but the car is not.

<TEXT>Dont get me wrong I love volkswagens, we have had Audis and Volkswagens for 10 years. We recently bought a 2007 Passat and during our 2nd oil change was told we needed a new engine. Our car has been in the shop for over 30 days and Volkswagen has been impossible to deal with. They have not offered to pay for our rental and now say that the cost incurred for this is going to be on us. What? I asked to be reimbursed for 2 car payments since I am still making them and reimbursement for the rental car and they told me "Nope sorry". Worst experience ever and my stupid car is still in the shop. Don't buy one, they are not cheap cars and not cheap to maintain. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had my first VW for 2 months, but so far, it's wonderful! I was a Toyota Solara owner for a long time; but with aging parents, they were not able to get into the back seat. I wanted a 4 door, sporty car and I finally found one. I told the dealers I was looking for 3 things: good-looking (inside and out), a comfortable car, and the right price. The Passat has it all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was hesitating when I purchased this 2007 Passat because of the bad reliability reviews on the previous models. But I was really impressed by its performance while test driving, besides, 90% part of 2007 Passat were made in Germany, so I assumed the manufacturer made some progress on it. So far I have been driving my Passat for 5 months and I love it very much. I don't regret that I chose Passat over Accord EX at the same price range, and I hope I don't regret my choice after several years. Now I am giving high rating for it. If there is anything happen in the future, I will follow up in Edmunds.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice acceleration after 30 mph; excellent handling; lots of options are included in the base model (you do not have to pay extra for MP3 aux-in, 4 one-button power windows, climate control, trip computer, power trunk release, etc.); excellent highway mileage (31-35 mpg for me).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I placed an order for a 2.0T manual sport package Passat sedan in late March and got the car in late June. The car is well worth the wait. After over 4 months, I'm still exploring the features available in this car, especially the radio system. I do mostly city driving, so that takes a hit on fuel economy (22-24 MPG). When I do get on the highway (27-31 MPG), though, this car wants to go!! Only time I had to take it to the shop was when I had the dash panels disconnected with a connector unplugged and I placed the key in the ignition to open the windows. A third party programming tool could have solved that problem without going to the dealer. I upgraded from a 1986 VW Golf.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine/transmission combo (same as combo in GTI/GLI); Brake/accelerator pedals are well spaced for heel-toe driving (pedal separation increased for 2008 models). Sport seats keep you supported, even for a big guy like me. Adaptive Xenon headlamps turn with the steering wheel and turn night into day.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Even though Consumer's Report gave the Passat a bad rating, I liked the handling better than any of the other cars I test drove - Altima, Camry, Accord, Prius, Acura. Before I took the leap, I called the service manager at several VW dealerships and asked them what kinds of repairs they were seeing. Everyone I spoke to said that they saw very few repairs for the '07 Passat and thought it was the best car in the VW line. So I ignored CR and took the plunge. I'm glad I did. The car handles like an expensive European sports car on turns. It is comfortable, stylish, responsive and reliable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the vw passat in candy apple white, sport package w/18" wheels, what a great looking car! The ride is exceptional, tight and confident. This feeling rises in proportion with the speedometer reading. Personal taste is subjective, but I truly believe that the lines of the passat are best accentuated when presented in candy apple white with 18" wheels. A real head turner. Odometer is approaching 10,000mi and no issues. Go for it !</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the car for 2.5 months and overall, I'm very satisfied. I also considered the Acura TL and Infiniti G35. Good blend of performance, fuel economy, and price for equipped features. The ride is firm, but not harsh. The interior is laid out nicely and is very comfortable. Lots of well-thought-out little touches, like the sun shades that are integrated into the rear doors and rear window. Some minor annoynances are the throttle lag, the satellite radio didn't work (after activating the service), the auto unlock sometimes doesn't work, and the car will creep forward with 'Hold' active. There is also an annoying airflow/buffeting issue with sunroof open when speed is 35-45 mph.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steerable xenon headlights. 12 way power driver and front-passenger seats. Adjustable console arm-rest. Side and rear window built-in sunshades. One touch up/down for all 4 windows.

<TEXT>I've had my VW Wolfsburg Passat for almost a week, and it is incredible! I just graduated from college, and I wanted to get rid of my 2002 Mazda Protege5. I wanted something more sophisticated, but still sporty enough to drive. At 6'3, it's difficult for me to fit into sport sedans. I couldn't fit into a Lexus IS, and getting a BMW 328i wouldn't be economical as I just got my first job. I got a great deal on this Passat, and I was hesitant at first about it. After researching the car on Edmunds and other auto sites, I see that this car has it all. The turbo is plenty powerful, and I barely feel the need to go into sport mode. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I wrote a review in January 07, I had given this car an overall rating of 9.4. The 2.0L VW Passat since then has been as close to a perfect vehicle as possible. The fuel economy is much better then expected, especially when you take a little care in not engaging the turbo. 0-60 acceleration is excellent, but where this car really shines is in how quickly the car achieves passing speed. I never, ever expected it to be that quick. Fit and finish is as good as it gets, and this has become the best, and th most favorite car I have ever owned. The latest vehicles I have had include a 2002 Maxima SE and a 2004 Maxima SE. The Passat has them beat.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine, even with what the experts call Turbo lag. Transmission is extremely smooth. Fit and finish. No rattles or squeaks, even after driving over lousy Manitoba, Canada roads. The stereo has very good sound. Trunk storage space. Heated leather seats are fast. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the '07 value edition not long after they came out in '06. Had minor computer issues initially, but otherwise the last year and half have been trouble free. Bought the silver one, tinted the windows and upgraded the wheels and tires and it really is a beautiful car. Have taken it on several long trips and my wife and daughter love it, very comfortable, quiet, plenty of room and averages about 31 mpg at 75 mph. Turbo engine is excellent - can't imagine why anyone would want the 6 cylinder.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Let me start by saying this is my 3rd vdub, I actually traded in my '07 GTI (manual) for the 2.0T passat with the sport package. All I have to say is that I wish I had done it earlier. Love the car, the inside is way cool, the leather smells great! Love the automatic windshield wipers and lights, the tiptronic tranny with the shift paddles, those things are fun. Overall a great car to get, can't wait to go on a family trip with it. Love the 17" BMW 525-looking rims - they give the car an awesome look!! And the sound system is flawless. Dual AC makes it great since the wifey doesn't like it too cold! I can't wait for my other lease to be up just so i can get another Passat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I happened to find this car on a lot in DC and negotiated the price before even test driving it. After owning this car for 10 days, I am amazed at how much fun this car is to drive. I also considered the G35, Acura TL (type s) and Buick Lacrosse Super. The Passat 3.6 engine with the sports package handles incredibly well and acceleration at all speeds is outstanding. A great every day family car. Also, I highly recommend the Dynaudio sound system as it is incredible. Although this car costs much more than a basic import sedan, it really is closer to an entry level Audi or C-class, but less money and more fun when equipped fully. A winner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>With sports pkg comparable with Audi A4/6 only faster, less money and isn?t seen at every stop light. Sports pkg has suspension w/ lowered ride ht, nice ten-spoke 18" wheels, paddle shifters, adj. sport seats (not made for wide bottoms). The 280hp VR-6 has a nice growl when you accelerate: 1/4 mi in 14.5 sec. at 100.2 mph, compare to others in R&T Mag test summary. It has a quirk: accelerator is non-linear and is tricky to master. Too light on the gas and you get a momentary blip of hesitation or if you step into it (no kidding) you light up the tires shocking your passengers. If you love car audio you must get the Dynaudio opt, exp at $1K but it rocks! Added bonus ? insurance is reasonable!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Paid $32k (plus tax and license) for Passat 4Motion wagon with Luxury Pack 1. AWD and enough room for gear are my primary buying concerns and this car has a good balance of that and luxury and performance. More expensive and more luxurious than a Subaru. I would highly recommend Edmunds Inside Line's review of this wagon. Definitely consider the increased cost of maintenance and premium gas when compared to the Subaru before you buy. Also there is an odd throttle delay on launch, but you can easily adapt your driving to this oddity. Tinting the windows is all the car needed to kick up the comfort and style to a serious level of unostentatious class.</TEXT>

When comparing this vehicle to others in the same class, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo and Acura, I was amazed at the amount of money I was able to save while still being able to ride in style. Heated leather seats, navigation, 6 disc CD changer, Tiptronic transmission, and a ton of safety features at no additional cost - how could you not fall in love. It's a NO brainer!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The first problem I had with this car before I drove it off the lot was the electric parking brake was stuck and I could not get it out of Park. Now at 23000 miles later, it is recurring. Also car idles loud like it was a diesel. They said it was the oil pump and replaced it. I?m wondering now if my car had proper lubrication. From time to time when turning my signals off, the opposite side goes on (confusing for the person behind me). Also the light came on the dash saying tires were low so I put the proper air required but the light would not go off. I found out the spare tire in the trunk was setting the low tire pressure signal off. Now go figure! Besides that ride is smooth, gas is ok.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 07 Passat in early November. I just got it out of the shop after they had it for 9 days. A check engine light came on during a road trip in the middle of nowhere. Not fun. Turns out the oil cooler bolt and bracket broke, so it and the timing assembly had to be changed. The car had less than 9k miles on it. Now, one week after having the car returned to me, it's in the shop again because the steering lock is malfunctioning. This is my 3rd VW and all of them have had major issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far it's been a good family cruiser, with lots of power. The sport suspension is a good setup. Couple of annoyances, I am 6'5", and find that the vertical height of the windshield is a bit low. I used to have 2001 Passat, with its higher windshield I found that outward visibility was better. The 07 Passat's windshield is raked further, which reduces the vertical height. Another issue is the transmission. Mine has a fairly bad hesitation as slow speed (< 10mph), it doesn't always want to go back to 1st gear. Overall the 3.6 motor is quite the little monster, great acceleration! I chipped mine with Revo which gets another 20hp. Recommended!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second new VW, and I am very happy with it. I was considering a number of other cars (the TL, a Lexus, an A4, and a BMW), but this one was easily the best, especially if you, like me, want a little bit of extra room. It's gotten a lot of compliments in terms of looks, but really it is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Fun to just drop the hammer sometimes. As an aside, I drive mostly on highways, and at, um, excessive speeds :) and my mileage is a bit above the 26 MPG listed here.</TEXT>

The ride is quiet and comfortable, the engine is responsive on the highway, the back seat is roomier than what we had, especially legroom. The free Sirius satellite radio is a plus as well.

<TEXT>There are too many things to love about the car, so I'll only list the cons: The navi takes getting used to, and for $1,800, there are PLENTY of things missing: 1) voice-recognition, 2) touchscreen capability, and 3) you can't play CDs while using the nav. The iPod: it's great having the dock connector and an aux input, but the display doesn't include artist/song/album info. Ridiculous! Also, the aux input should be in the armrest, not next to the dock in the glovebox. The Dynaudio is crystal clear even at high volumes, but needs more bass. My Sirius capability didn't work and had to return for servicing immediately after I got it. Bummer. There's a button for it but no Bluetooth!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sport package is the ONLY way to go on the Passat. Beautiful 18" rims, lowered suspension, sexy seats, etc. Features galore for a non-luxury car. I don't need to repeat what's already been repeatedly said, but I'll do it again: this is easily on par with Acuras, BMWs, Lexuses & the rest!</FAVORITE>

The transmission and clutch operate like butter (the best FWD manual I ever drove). The handling of the car is a little strange at hi-way speeds, on lane changes with the DSC on, the frt. end bobs and sways a little.With the DSC disengaged (off) the car is neutral and reacts normally, strange for a safety feature. My MFD display has started to fade in warm weather the dealer has ordered parts, hopefully this is a one time occurence. </TEXT>

Went looking and the Passat was high on the list. As soon as I saw the Wolfsburg edition I was sold. Almost everything you would want: MP3 CD changer, heated seats, steering wheel controls, fog lights; I saw it on a Saturday and drove out Monday afternoon. I have leased 4 GM SUVs in the last 10 years and I am more excited about this car than all of them. If you are in the market for a great car this is the one you want, but hurry only 6000 Wolfsburgs, if you miss one, wait if you can - a 50 state legal TDI is coming out in the fall. </TEXT>
