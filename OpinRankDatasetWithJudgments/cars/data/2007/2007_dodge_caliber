<TEXT>Before I purchased this vehicle I drove the matrix and other comparable vehicles also I compared them for saftey and found that caliber was by far the best buy, now that I've owned it for 3 years and have friends that have over 100,000 miles with no problems, I'm convinced that my next vehicle will be another caliber I like the hard quality interior it stands up much better then the soft plastic. All about the car gives it high rating in my books. and unlike the others I feel safer driving it. I'm glad I didn't listen to the so-called experts that judge a vehicle for interior trim. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a very nice 2004 Jeep Liberty for this thing, I got it out of the showroom. (GOD I wish it were back in there.) I've had it at the dealership for fuel smell in the car while driving. They say they can't find anything wrong with it, my husbands a mechanic he says their crazy, but it's under warranty so they should fix it. I've had to have it lined up because it eats tires up on the inside, and I'm fixing to replace tires for the 2nd time, it only has 31,000 miles on it. I really wish I could trade it in, but the Dodge place only offered me $9,000 for it and it is in excellent shape, they know the cars are junk.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2007 Caliber SXT 2.0L w CVT. Currently at 83000 KM or 52000 Miles. Very reliable .. only repair was a lower control arm which had to be replaced (apparently common cause dealer had 7 in stock Drivers side only) Car interior is not designed for anyone 6 ft or taller. I'm 6'5" and my right knee is always rubbing against the center console. Blind spots are bad.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought mine used w/13000 miles on it.Now have 25000 miles with no problems.Orginal tires w/good tread and no uneven wear issues.Love the interior b/c it is easy to wipe and clean (important w/2 young kids :).No transmission or other issues some have discussed-think that has to do mostly w/how you drive your car.Only complaint is that I only average 20 city & about 25 highway (nowhere near the 26-32 advertised :().Also, have CVT and acceleration could be smoother when getting out of 2nd gear to highway speeds.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own a 2007 Dodge Caliber R/T AWD. This is the baddest gas guzzler yet of the Caliber models. I swear I get 15 miles a gallon w/ it. The window ticket claims 32 highway miles a gallon...yeah right. If I pull out into traffic I am so afraid I'll get T-Boned cause it doesn't GO! It goes when it wants too. I blow threw tires like mad! On my third set in 2, yes I sad 2 years. Dealership wouldn't even see if there was anything wrong w/ the car. Blamed it on on the tires. "It's the tires, NOT the car." Gimme a break already. Now I'm at 46K and my warranty is up, but I got the 3 year extended that Chrysler has no info on!!! I'll never by another dodge. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The "PLASTIC" Rims?? Heck no! Had then replaced once already. I like the sunroof...wait scratch that. That was warranty fixed and hasn't been the same since. Maybe the speakers? Nope replaced also and still sounds scrathy. The only thing I like is the color. ORANGE.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After reading all the other reviews, I can't believe how lucky I've been with my car. In fact, I'm retiring in 6 years and plan on keeping this car for my retirement car. I've had over 20 cars in the past (sports cars too) but really put this one close to the top. We had 48 inches of snow on the ground last year, and I never once had a problem with driving! Handles great-- and this is on snowy, curvy country roads. Chrysler offers a Lifetime Warranty now (if you have the lifetime powertrain) and I'm in the process of purchasing that--just in case. The only thing I've had go wrong, is the signal switch broke last week and it had to be replaced. Not bad for 410000 miles!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the space in the cargo area-- great "garage sale" car. Seats are comfortable--my back doesn't get sore on those long trips. Really enjoyed the flip down speakers last month at our family reunion--played music all night!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The R/T moves and handles very well. The 2.4L "world engine" developed by Daimler, the AWD/suspension and 18"wheels are the difference. Very good fit and finish. Lesser models of the Caliber are adequate, but sound and ride like something the Russians would make. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We spend a great deal of travel time in the car; to and from work, family matters, and or just in weekend pleasure. Choosing the purchase of car we drive says a great deal about you. I'm impressed with the Caliber's simple, yet sexy exterior body form. It's unique design is so smoothly unisex the owner's gender is undetectable. The interior also stately designed to feed, masculine and feminine egos, ample room, big instrument knobs and easy manipulations. Very smooth and "jumpy" in a good way ride. Accelaration - oookay, could be better. Worth the asking price when compared to other vehicles in like categories. Enjoying my ride </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless entry with fading interior lighting. CVT, and comfortable seating. The specialities, cup illumination, cellphone and beverage compartments, outlets etc. In my case my beige pebble interior matches the exterior khaki color nicely, in short all the amenities are rightly placed</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Hello world! I have the Sunburst Orange SXT with all the bells and whistles. Definitely an eye catcher and never a shortage on conversation whether at the gas pump or grocery store. This is a nice fun vehicle, great for traveling as well as city driving. Being in the great state of Texas, driving to Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and Houston (all cities are about 240 miles apart ? est. 230 - 250 on at tank of gas) this vehicle is fun! And yes, good acceleration from 0-60 as well as surprisingly good passing speeds. Stable at the 3-digit speeds as well ? Oops, did I say that? </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I like my Dodge Caliber. There are tons of neat little storage places and innovative interior features. The body design is new and different, and I love it. The engine bogs down a lot on inclines and from a stand still. The design has way too many blind spors especially when backing up. I was nervous about buying a vehicle in the first model year, and I don't think my skepticism is unfounded, but I don't have nearly as many issues as I had feared. The AC is having some issues along with the rear defroster. Overall, the car is good and I will definitely drive it for years to come.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A cooler in the glove box? Awesome! (if the AC worked properly) The cup holders light up. The seats are comfortable and the gear shift is different. Aesthetically speaking, the car is fabulous</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife can be rough on cars so I wanted something that she could manuveer easily, get around in snow and ice and have enough room for all of us (2 teens). It's nothing like my Dodge Ram Laredo but this is a very nice little car. I have been buying Chrysler/Dodge products for sometime now, primarily because I like the products but the dealership also played a big role. The Caliber is very comfortable, with adjustable seats (albeit manual) that raise and lower the driver. Very nice. We had to "trick" out the car in order to get the AWD but it really makes a pleasant driving experience. We'll take the four door Ram for really long trips but this one is perfect for my "supermom".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, transmission, roominess, ease of loading for groceries etc., handling and style. It is really a mini-SUV when you get the AWD. The leather interior is well done. It has the feel of a much more expensive car. Sirius radio is great. This will make a great car for my teenager in 3 years.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love that the mechanical design is simple. It's easy and cheap to maintain. No timing belt/internal water pump to worry about. I can change the spark plugs or fuel injectors in 20 minutes. Well planned. The car is very composed on the road and easy to drive. It seems well-balanced and feels lighter than it is (3,000lbs). Steering is sporty, acceleration is adequate with the 2.0L but won't win any races. I have a creaking driver's seat, but the dealer should fix that. Also my knee runs into the center console. Other than that, no complaints. I recommend this car. It has a lot more character than anything else for $16,500. </TEXT>

I also love the car for weekend camping/fishing trips. I can pack the tent, supplies, and even the dog with no problems. My daughter is counting the days until she turns 16 and can stake her claim for the driver's seat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car a little over a month ago for my husband. It's the first car he's ever truly loved! He finds the seats more comfortable than I do as I require more back support. The interior is gorgeous but very plastic and scratches easily. There is little glare from the dash onto the windshield though. The features this car has are great! A glove box cooler, fantastic air conditioner (dare I say freezing cold in the summer? and we're in TX!) lots of leg room and the steering wheel sits out farther than most cars and is larger in size, perfect for my husband. The exterior is sharp and very attractive, lights (in and out) are perfect, tinting dark, stereo incredible and very roomy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Glove box cooler!! nice dash and cup holder lighting effects, roomy, fun to drive, very responsive, brakes are sharp and quick, did I mention fun to drive? Stereo is incredible and has an iPod/mp3 plug, freezing cold air conditioner, interior/exterior styling is just gorgeous! Great gas mileage!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At 13000 miles had to get a tire rotation. There was a noise coming from the tires, and also tires seems to be out of alignment? At 16,000 miles had to go back for same reason, but this time they found that all 4 tires were out of alignment and the tires were cupping badly enough to warrant new tires already. Dodge refused to replace tires, and Firestone refused as well since it was an alignment problem (and Dodge's responsibility</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Dodge Caliber thus far has proven to be a very nice car and a solid contender in the small car bracket. The performance will not blow you away, but with average mileage in the 30's one cannot expect Viper stats. The overall quality seems to be good, no rattles, squeeks or the like.

It is a peppy little car on the take off and it runs very quiet. Much leg room for our 15 yr old. who's 6ft. tall, and room to spare for the family dog.

<TEXT>Studying to be a mechanical engineer, it took me about 1.5 years to finally find a car that would "pass the test." My wife has a 60 mile commute to work every day so we needed something safe with good gas mileage. That's why we bought the Caliber. She wanted an SUV, but I didn't want the maintenance associated with 4 wheel drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I started my research on the Caliber about 2 months before my purchase to try an figure out what "world" engine meant. Basically "world" engine means that the motor was designed by Chrysler, Mercedes, Mitsubishi and Hyundai. They are going to build 1.8 million of these motors anually.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I absolutely love my new Caliber. It is my 3rd car, and let me tell you, it is definitely the best. I drive it back and forth to college twice a week, which is 100mi each way. I've never had any problems with it. The headlighs are awesome! Seats are extremely comfortable. I have both front seats the whole way back and my cousins who are all 5'10 and taller have virtually no problem getting in and out. It does lag a bit from 0-40, but once you hit 40 it just goes. One review said it was not agile, not at all true. Very responsive and safe. The 5 star saftey rating one reason I bought it. It can also go through quite a bit of snow, AWD or no AWD.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the space! I love all the room this car gives me. I've moved in and out of a dorm with it. Seats are really comfy. All my passengers have said that they feel like they're in an SUV b/c of the higher seating platform. Gas mileage is good. It could always be better, but I usually get 32mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought our R/T off of the showroom floor. The first in our area in July of '06. I had my doubts when we test drove it. I was used to driving a V6. But all in all we wanted a new good gas mileage car with cargo room. We took it on a long trip and avg 27 mpg. Not bad. The only downfall for us on this car was the acceleration. It just doesn't have that "get up and go". It actually got to the point of us being hesitant to pull out into traffic. We only had it for 6 mths and traded it in. I would say the Caliber is a good choice for someone who needs a smaller car with good gas mileage and cargo room. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car since February. Handling is excellent, car is just fun to drive. The styling is edgy enough to make it stand out. The inferno red doesn't hurt either. Shortcomings are the rear visibility when backing up, you really have to get used to it. The other thing is I upgraded to the 6 disc nav system, don't do it. You lose the MP3 input and it just really isn't user friendly on the music side. Had I known I would have stuck with the standard radio and CD and bought a Tom Tom. Other than that, the car has been good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Caliber for what it is a gas miser. I did want some amenties like the power options and 17" tires which adds to the handling. This is a heck of an econo car. Yes, it's a compromise of practicality and a mini vehicle deigned around a blob of clay stuck in a wind tunnel. What can you say other than $16K, full car size, ride, and comfort with the gas milage of mini-car. Yes I could get better for around $9K more but if you compare apples to apples for the money, there is no other apple. If you want the room of a real size car and the economy of a midget car plus the ability to actually haul something other than you? This is it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Variable timing engine. The heart of a vehicle is the drivetrain and this is state of the art. Interior space. It can actually haul real people and gear. Truck style seating with drivers side height adjustment, much better on the back. Styling, it turns heads. The entry level price. The ride</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Downgraded from A4 looking for more room and better gas mileage for under $20k. Definitely a nice amount of room to work with considering the overall size of the package. Gas mileage doesn't impress, but solid mid-to-high 20s in mostly highway driving. I've put almost 8k miles in about 4 months and haven't had a problem. I do miss the AWD, though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a '96 Jeep Cherokee with 262k miles and was looking for a RAV4 when I stumbled upon the 2.0 Caliber SXT. For the money, I couldn't ask for more. It rides very well, plenty of leg room in front and back. With 2 grown boys I needed head and leg room. I do wish the console/armrest was a little higher and cushy. I thought the chill zone was a cool idea, but should be colder. I am loving my new car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am one of those people that researches beyond the necessary. I did my research and narrowed it down between the Dodge Caliber and Jeep Patriot. I went with the Caliber and couldn't be happier. The comfort is amazing and that is saying something since I am 6'5", 230lbs. This vehicle fit me the best and also leaves room for someone to sit behind me comfortably which is a first. The speed is great for a 2.0 4 cylinder. The upgraded stereo with the 9 speaker boston acoustics is well worth the extra money. Could't be happier!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo, this thing is amazing, with the setting only at half way the base vibrates through you body. The highs and lows are crystal clear. Yes issential seats - this works great as I was able to wipe coffee off no problem. 60/40 seats </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I only suggest that the inside is a little to compact. I fele squished driving. The back seat cup holders should retract in and out so a third person can sit in the back. I love the car just need a little more room. Although it is a compact car it is so great on gas. I love that. I did experience a trouble time. It only happened once, but I had my headlights on and when I turned my turn signals on the whole head lights turned completely off. When the turn signals were off the lights came on. I also, when driving that night, when heat and radio were on the whole console got extremely hot to touch. Just a fluke but scary. Yes lights were on, not daytime runnng lites. Great car though! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a 4 cyl. AWD vehicle for my wife to commute with. The AWD works great in the snow and rain, but there is no get up and go when it comes to accelerating fom a stop. I also own a Honda Accord with the 4 cyl., and with 12 less HP. The Honda has alot more pep. The Caliber feels extremely sluggish with the CVT transmission. The fuel economy is not bad, but a slightly larger tank to increase the range would be nice. I look forward to trading this in for an AWD Magnum, and paying a little more for gas. This would be excellent for a new driver, but not for a family of 4. This is a good car for around town grocery getting, but thats about it. Test drive well before you buy!</TEXT>

Car feels tight and solid, just right. The 1.8 liter engine is peppy enough for me, though steep hills will challenge it. Stereo sounds fine. Seats fit well. Headrests offer good protection.

<TEXT>My SXT 2.0L was totalled after 3 months of ownership. I didn't like it enough to buy another one. The interior design is spacious and comfortable, but if you have anything inside it is seen. No storage space. The little extras are nice, but don't make up for the weak paint, under-quality interior and extreme lag in acceleration. My husband bumped the side with his belt cell phone holder getting in the car and it scratched the paint bad. No way it should've done damage at all. It does corner very tight and is super- responsive (overcorrection and wrecking was easy to do). The vehicle overall was okay, but I definitely didn't fall in love with it and it was my very first new car.</TEXT>

With a 2 year-old child that was such a pain getting her in and out of the back seat. With the Caliber I have no problems at all. Plus the leg room is great. I am tall and need my knee room, the adjustable drivers seat is the best yet. My brother in law in 6foot 7inches and he fit in the back seat with plenty of room for the front passanger and for himself. Dodge did a good thing coming out with the Caliber.

<TEXT>I am happy overall-not a bad value but- I noticed right away some little things on the vehicle that were not up to the quality I'm used to. The "plastic" parts" (door frames, etc.) scratch and stain easily and are dificult to get clean. The rear window and trim do not come clean at the car wash, they need hand scrubbing. My biggest complaint is with the mileage I drive I require an oil change about every 4-6 weeks. I can't find anyone to give me an oil change (they don't have the filter) other than the dealer at 2x the price and the dealer is always a long wait. I am always late from lunch.

<TEXT>After six months of ownership I can say that the car has been dependable in temperatures from -15c to +40c and always started first try. Perfomance and handling on the car are quite impressive, the ride is stable and predictable on dry/wet/snowy conditions.

As well as the long list of standard features on the SXT I opted for the security package adding the trunk cover, alarm system and cabin air filter.

<TEXT>I really love my car except the gas mileage keeps getting worse. I used to get 340 to 360 miles to the tank and now I'm lucky to get 300. I've been told it depends on the driver and the conditions but I'm not the only one complaining. Maybe Dodge will take notice and fix this.The seats are wonderful! I have a bad back and these seats make all the difference after a long drive. Take off isn't fast but after first gear, you're really moving. It hugs corners very well but the blind spot needs improvement. The arm rest could be more sturdy and maybe have less rattling when extended.

<TEXT>We purchased the Caliber because my previous Dodge cars were great. The trend stops here. Since having the last routine service done, the car has been in the shop 4 times. One was for a faulty engine light sensor (this still hasn't been fixed), and most recently (and most alarming) because after plugging in the block heater overnight, the engine light came on again. The service department finally ran a full diagnostics and found that there was a "software deficiency" in that plugging in the caroverheats some component and causes the engine light to come on. They advised us not to plug in the car. We live in Canada, and it is currently -30C out. We must start the car every 4 hours. No ETA on a fix yet!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my first Caliber back in 4/06. It was white and the only one available on the lot as they are sold so quickly. So I bought it. I kept returning to the dealership until I saw a red Caliber in Oct. and traded my car on the spot. It cost me a over $1,000 plus more money to trade than I thought it would, but I believed that since this would be my last new vehicle purchase it had to be the color I wanted. The red is such a hot, beautiful red (pearl), I drove off with it that very day. I have only one complaint. The steering wheel does not shift up and down enough. It hardly moves at all. A little larger trunck space would be great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. It is easy to drive has excellent road handling. I spend about $30 every 2 weeks to fill it up and I drive about 700 miles a month. The bigger tires make it easy to drive in the rain and the brakes don't sqeak like the Neon I had before did. It has a great stereo system in it and the cooler in the glove box is the only thing I think is a gimmick. The cans or bottles have to be ice cold to put in there and in the winter it will not work because you have to have the A/C on to use it. I am really pleased with this car and would recommend anyone to buy one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really enjoy the look of the car. I bought the R/T instead of getting the Compass. Sirius radio for 12 months is also a great deal. When in auto it tends to lose HP but when you flip the autostick on you feel an extra boost. Lots of storage places and the AUX input jack comes in handy with my I-Pod. I seem to be the only person around with an R/T and it attracts a lot of attention for only being a $23,000 car. Really fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 13 months of owning a Ford 2005 Mustang, I decided to go back to a Dodge after I had owned a 2000 Intrepid for five years and never had a problem with it. The Mustang was hot, but my girls were not comfortable in a 2-door car, plus the gas prices skyrocketed right after I bought it and I was paying $120 to $160 in gas per month. My girls and I like the Caliber because it has four doors, still looks good, is better on gas (even buying premium gas, only $100 per month at the max), easier to see out of, and I used it to take my older daughter to college without having to rent an SUV. It has so much more room than the Ford (which is great for a single person), and is enjoyable to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Split-fold rear seats. MP3 player jack (no MP3 CDs to mess with). Lower insurance costs. Side air bags. Better fuel efficiency, looks like a baby Durango!

<TEXT>I've waited 3 months to give an honest review of my SXT. Ihave averaged 25.8 to 30 mpg city and hwy, and am in constant bumper to bumper traffic to and from work. When the car is in park it is difficult to maneuver the air controls as the stick is in the way, and the blind spot is a bit bothersome. Yes there's noise, but that doesn't bother me. I did months of research before I purchased this car so I can say the pluses outweigh the negatives. Fun to drive, reliable and has a smooth transmission with the CVT. It turns heads, and is lots of fun to drive. This crossover car is sure to influence other car makers to wake up and smell the coffee! You won't be dissapointed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the Caliber last week, and so far so good. Got the SXT and am pleased with the cars performance as compared to my Neon. The only negative so far is the sound system. It's adequate,(especially when playing a CD), but that's about it. Also, be sure to ask for mats as they are not included on many models. The Caliber handles well, but is a bit sluggish accelerating. The front seats have a nice height adjuster and all the storage compartments are nice as well. However if you slide the armrest forward there is little room to use the 2nd cup holder. Overall, I'm pleased and would recommend the Caliber. If it lasts as long as the Neon that will be great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I probably was one of the first people to get a Caliber. I love the look of the car. People always look when I drive. When I get gas people always ask questions. The plastic underneath the car rattles at high speeds. Also, I think a spark plug is knocking. Everytime I hit the gas, I get a knocking/metal hitting something sound. It needs more pickup. When it rains or I go to a carwash, the engine steams like it is overheating. Also, the chillzone does not work. No air comes out of the vent. The flashlight is broken also. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking for more than a month at different vehicles, we happily chose the Caliber. We have been very happy with the mileage, but we have noticed a "shift" when we slow down. At 15 mph there is a change in speed or shift or something. We are very happy with all the bells and whistles, even if they don't all make sense. The "Chill Zone" does need a latch, and doesn't cool down a bottle of water, but will keep it cool. The tire pressure feature worries me, as I know some day, someone is going to steal my valve caps.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 Doge Caliber R/T brand new! I have had it three years and have not had any real problems. I have only had to replace the tires and regular maintenance. Over all I am satisfied with the car. However my battery died 3 weeks ago and was replaced. Within 2 days of replacement the check engine light came on. I went to the dealer who downloaded some computer software and the light went away. Two days later the light is on again!!!! I just left the dealer with another alleged computer malfunction! IDK!!! It's off now but I'm hoping that in another two days the light is not back on again or I'm not going to be a nice customer!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car over two years now, bought used. It had been a rental and well cared for. In the past I have always had bigger vehicles (still have a Ford full size van) because I am 6' 4" and most smaller cars are impossible for me to drive. This car fits me very well, plenty of head and leg room, really like the height adjustable driver seat. I was looking for a smaller fuel efficient car for driving around town and this one has been all I was looking for. Yes it is not as well made as my bigger cars, but the price reflects that. New front tires at 40,000 miles, rear still have some life. So far no mechanical problems, transmission is doing fine, I have to say I am happy with it.</TEXT>

We have just passed 45,000 miles on our Caliber, and we are very happy with our purchase. First set of tires (Firestone) were just replaced with better riding (General Altimax HP), although I could have gotten a few thousand more miles from the originals. Other than new tires and occasional oil/filter changes(5,000 miles), car has not had any problems at all. Still looks good,and performs like new. Very reliable car.

<TEXT>I've only owed it for 3 months, but so far it is great. Fuel mileage is everything they say it is. I get slightly over 31 mpg. It's comfortable inside, and looks great outside. Because it has an excellent safety rating, the insurance costs are low. The rear seats fold back which gives me a huge amount of space for cargo. Stereo system is not bad either. If there is one thing that I do not like it would be that trying to check your blind spot on the driver's side is nearly impossible. I solved this with a blind spot mirror attached to the outside mirror. Other than that I am a very happy Dodge Caliber owner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It came down to a Caliber or Focus. I bought the Caliber because it claimed 26/30mpg and looked more comfortable. Big mistake. On a recent cross country trip I averaged 25.1 mpg. It ruined the whole trip. I spent more than budgeted for gas. As if this wasn't bad enough, when I returned home I wrote to the local dealership and DiamlerChrysler HQ to report my opinion. That was over 2 weeks ago, and as of yet I have not heard from either. I had a PT with the same engine and averaged almost 28 mpg over the time I had it. Should have kept it. It may have been the one exception to the rule, but it worked. My Caliber may be the bad apple, but it still stinks. The failure of Dodge to reply also stinks</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Blue One in Jersey</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Waited almost 3 months for delivery. Nice exterior styling, looks like a poor-man's X3. Interior styling is generally good too but quality of plastic is visibly poor. Does not have a lockable compartment to keep personal belongings. Ride is generally good, even at 80 mph on Jersey turnpikes. Acceleration is quite sluggish, probably due to CVT. Very easy to bump transmission into semi-manual mode accidentally. Visibility front and back is rather poor. Have to sit high to get good view in front which leads to reduced headroom. UConnect and trip computer both work quite well. Feels like driving a rental (based on years of biz travel experience) but great for daily commute, especially in bad weather.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently bought this car because we needed something reliable to drive. We wanted something fun and economical plus the price was great for a brand new car. We have had nothing but a great time driving this car. The way it handles on tight corners and in parking lots is wonderful, and we love the safety features. For fuel mileage on the first tank I got about 28 miles to the gallon, which was tons better than my 98 Isuzu Rodeo which got about 14. We love the headlights. They are better for driving at night because they give you a better field of vision. All in all this car is a dream to own.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to be my first "business car" for the mileage and economy. So far everything I have tested has been great and functioned great! Finally a vehicle with an awesome sound system from the factory. It handles what I throw at it and more. Awesome amount of cargo room. I haul around computer parts all day, so that was one of the key factors on this car. Mileage has varried from about 22mpg to 28mpg mixed city/hwy - I admit I step on the gas more than I should. I bought this to replace driving my 2001 Dakota due to the 12mpg it was giving me.</TEXT>

I have been blown away by the vehicle's smooth manual transmission and by the small yet powerful engine!! The commercials are right, "It's anything but cute!!!" The interior is very spacious and very comfortable to ride in. This vehicle is the definition of a smooth ride and I am glad that I chose this particular vehicle! The economy of this vehicle is simply outstanding! Great gas mileage for the size of the Caliber! I had to wait about 3 months to get my Caliber... but trust me, it was defiintly worth the wait! </TEXT>

I mostly use the "autostick" which does give me a more power on take off. Overall, though, I love it. I get questions from people all the time - get stared at a lot when sitting at traffic lights!!! The optional Boston 9 speaker system is awesome - the chiller could be a bit cooler, but who cares about that - no biggie. Can't wait for the SRT Turbo version to come out!! I bought the "inferno red" R/T with the upgraded chrome wheels, sunroof, red seat inserts/dash panel - it's gorgeous! </TEXT>

<TEXT>It is about time someone built a four door family car that has some attitude. We bought our Caliber SXT about a week ago and have loved every minute of it. As I guy I like the power and height of a truck or full size SUV but my wife can't keep the keys out of my hands. The Caliber sits up high and being able to adjust the seat height (with ample head room) makes this car great for those of us who don't like little cars. I don't even need to mention how great the exterior of the car looks, wow is that front end mean. But it is the little things in the interior that make it a winner. Front and rear leg room, tire pressure, lighted cup holders I could go on and on.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Where to start, the exterior is mean and masculine for a four door hatchback. Great smooth ride. The interior is very roomy with little things that you would find on a far more expensive car.

With the electronically controlled throttle, there isn't much throttle response til you're about 3/4 through the gear. I have also experienced torque-steer at higher rpms.

I have 1000 miles on it now with thank god no issues to report not even the Caliber ding that some are talking about. The MP3 port is awesome and A/C is very cold.

Originally, we set out to purchase a used 2004/2005 Nissan/Honda/Toyota with less than 30,000 miles. The price range on these cars was $15,000 to $17,000. We then checked on the all-new 2007 Caliber and found we could get the SXT version for $17,800. That was three months ago and the car now has 5,000 miles on it. There have been no problems whatsoever; the car averages about 30 miles per gallon; there's loads of interior space; more than adequate power; and excellent bulid quality and design.

<TEXT>We have owned our R/T AWD for a month now & we love it. We fight over it every day. We are extremely impressed with the quality of the car & the gas mileage. We average 29mpg & have had over 32mpg at times. We drive it 120 miles round trip & the majority are highway miles. The Boston Acoustics stereo easily drowns out any new model rattles. The electronicly controlled 6 spd like CVT runs smoothly but is a little jerky when slowing down. But, we seldom need to apply the brakes as the downshifting slows the car naturally. We don't have the moonroof & it has ample headroom. 18" rims without the chrome are perfect on this car. We tinted the windows & the car looks awesome! Great car to buy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a Tahoe in April to get better mileage. I really liked the styling better than the other cars in this class. I have a 1.8 sxt. Loved the extra features that didn't cost an arm and a leg (heated seats, 6 disc in dash, Cool Zone, etc). Also, I am 6'3, and it has a lot of head and leg room. I don't feel cramped like I do in my wife's Civic. I have been pleasantly surprised by the car. However, it has developed a pinging noise and Dodge has said it is a "non issue". I don't get 30 mpg, more like 26. However, after driving a Tahoe, anything is better than that. Also, random warning lights have come on, but they go off when restarted. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, Decent stereo, Plastic back deck, and the 17"rims. The car handles really well. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I absolutly love this car. We have had a few small problems. They had to change a wiring harness and fix the exhaust (rattle). We have the 2.0 CVT SXT Sport which is kind of strange at first since it does not switch gears but once you get use to it it's great. Due to this being a new car the dealerships do not have parts in inventory so we had to bring it in 5 times. Other then the little bugs and inconvienience of bringing it in 5 times I would recomend this car to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Caliber two months ago, and I am in love with it! It handles very well both on the street, as well as the freeway. The only complaint I have with the Caliber are the driver and passenger headrests because they aren't very comfortable. Other than that, the Caliber is flawless. It is very easy and fun to drive, and surprising easy to clean and maintain. I'd recommend this car to anyone who is in the market for a new car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature of the Caliber is the dashboard and the armrest in between the driver and passenger. It is very easy to change gears, and the interior looks stunning at all times. The gages are very easy to read, and the ipod cradle comes in very handy when I'm driving. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is so much fun to drive, rides and handles very well with the 17" tires. Once I got used to the CVT it has good acceleration for the small engine. If you're looking for a mini suv/wagon/sedan for about $20,000, check this vehicle out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The color, Marine Blue Pearl, gets so may compliments. People walk up to me at the car wash and ask to look at the car. Very comfortable driver seat. Exterior design is great. The Interior holds 4 comfortably. I love the dashboard radio controls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am incredibly disappointed at the lousy gas mileage this car gets. I bought it because it was the only car in its class that advertised 26 mpg and many of the reviews raved about the great gas mileage. I don't know where these people live, but I'm getting close to 20mph. I know I'm using the air, but still, I was better off with my larger more powerful Intrepid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Caliber. Great fuel economy, styling, and cool features. I'm getting about 38 mpg going back and forth to work. I get a lot of looks and comments where ever I go. There are some real cool features that make the car special; lighted cup holders (I don't have to guess where to put my coffee cup, the glove box cooler can hold four cans or bottles of pop and keep them cold (the other day I had a candy bar that was melting... so I put it in the glove box cooler and it was good to eat by the time I got home), there's a detachable rear dome light that doubles as a flash light (I used it to fix a friends car one night), and the rear speakers can be detached for parties.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a real winner. I love the gas mileage 1st of all. Then, I have to get into the drive and looks. Drives like a mid size car, no pings that most small cars have. Looks more like a guys car I have to admit. Definite tough look exterior wise, but drives well with great comfort. Love the glow in the dark drink holders and the shift located below the dash. Real retro and funky inside. Oh, not to mention the keep cool compartment located in the glove compartment. I definite hit from Chrysler.</TEXT>

<TEXT>No problems and I avg 30 MPG. Tons of features and good fit and finish. Was not looking for the color I got but it stands out and be ready for attention (Sunburst Orange). Tons of space on the inside with very versatle interorior configurations. CVT is something to get used to. It definitly saps some of the engines power, but it makes up for it in fuel economy. Overall way underated but much better then the others I drove. For the same price you get a much bigger car with way better features. The rated MPG is very close to actuall unlike the Honda & Toyota I drove.. They may be faster, but thats all. PS. the integrated chill zone cooler really works and is very cool! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the R/T for about 2.5 months now and love it. Have put on 3500 miles with no problems. Need an oil change though. I am 6'6" and have a 100 mile round trip daily commute to work so I needed a commuter with some style. This one does the job and is very comfortable for tall people looking for a smaller car with decent gas mileage. Looks sharp and makes the drive fun. Handles better than I expected on the curves and very reasonably priced. I hope to have it around a long time. With rear seat folded I can put in my dog kennel for my 85lb German Shepard without any space issues as well. The little extras are nice but AWD and 176HP with autoshift and leather for around 20g is a good deal!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like the setup of the cruse control. Can be bumped up and down easily for freeway driving, much better than my 96 Dodge pickup. Leg room and seat adjustments are very nice. Gauges all read easily and computer is easy to adjust.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Most of the views I read talked about how unhappy everyone was with the "cheap" feeling of the interior. This is an economy car, not a BMW. I feel that my purchase was worth every penny when I compared what I got on the Caliber compared to the Fit, Yaris and Focus. I just needed a great car to get to work and grad school, but also be able to take a canoe trip with friends.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the space, the position of the gears (yes, most people hated this), lighted gages, 17 inch wheels, stylish look. I just have so much fun driving this car and comfortable to think I'd survive an accident compared to the Fit or Yaris. I love sitting off the ground!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had nothing but imports my whole life. I've loved the design and reliability that Japan could offer me. When looking for a new car, I had a list of features that I needed. 4WD or AWD, a peppy engine, good handling, good styling, and around 20 Grand. I tested a lot and after testing the Caliber R/T I was convinced. It has alot of value in these catagories. The ride and acceleration are ultra smooth. The autostick and CVT feel generous and ready when accelerating, but jerky when breaking and downshifting. The handling is crisp for the size of the vehicle. But sharp cornering shows its high center of gravity. The end wants to wiggle loose. But the AWD system corrects minor over steer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling is very bold. I've owned the car for 2 weeks now and I'm still not sure if it's a wagon or an SUV. The cabin is very comfortable (If a little plasticy). The stereo sounds deep and resonate, and plays 6 CDs or MP3 discs (thats about 1100 songs) The CVT and Autostick. The AWD system.</FAVORITE>

At first, my friends thought I was totally insane until they rode in it one day on the way to lunch. Much more room on the inside and more practical! Even my husband likes it because of the room. Not very good on acceleration, but hey, I'm used to an 8-cylinder Mustang! I absolutely love this car! Inside and out, she's awesome.

<TEXT>I have a 60 mile daily commute so fuel efficiency is mandatory. However, since that commute is through Wisconsin it is also necessary that my vehicle is able to handle rough roads/weather. Being the mother of 2 very active boys I refuse to sacrifice on interior space, this car is roomy enough for my 2 kids and the family dog (shepherd & collie mix) to sit in the back seat together comfortably. Even though it's a 4 cyl, it could easily keep up with my 3.2 V6 Intrepid. Its safety features put it in a class of its own for a lower priced car. This car looks sporty but is still a great family car. I didn't think I could find a car that met all of my needs and this one met and far exceeded them. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best feature= interior is very easy to clean! Smart airbag (kids can sit up front and airbag disables itself) Very roomy interior. Love the drivetrain= really smooth ride.

It is just a great all the way around< we did own a dodge ram 1500 quad cab and I thought we may not like the caliber because of the size but it has a lot of room and gets great gas mileage.

<TEXT>This car is great on gas mileage. It is an inexpensive car, so that explains the lack of interior and exterior quality. However, I think that this car gives the college student or small family car person a great choice. I've previously owned a Lexus and a Trans Am. If you want the quality of a Lexus you are going to have to pay the high price. If you want power the go buy a car that gets 10 miles to the gallon. If you're looking for medium quality, excellent gas mileage, and a low cost then this is a great buy.</TEXT>

I'm now the proud owner of a black SXT 2.0, CVT, fully loaded, sunroof, MusicGate, and tinted windows-black in the back. I've seen reviews suggesting lackluster speed-Not mine! I'm always first off the line, and passing is a breeze. It's no race car-after all it is a 4cyl-but it does its job well. No excessive wind noise-ofcourse I've got the Vault on Sirius blasting!

<TEXT>I traded in a Dodge Dakota V8 to save on fuel costs. The Caliber has comfortable seating compared to other smaller cars. It has a smooth ride. The second day of driving I noticed a high pitched ringing noise. This appears to be the high pressure fuel pump. The dealer and Chrysler refuse to acknowledge it is a problem and refused to replace the pump. I don't think I should hear the fuel pump operating inside the vehicle. It did not make that sound when I took delivery but started 100 miles later. It is very annoying unless you listen to loud music that drowns out the sound.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 17 inch aluminum wheels give the feel of riding higher like a truck. The leather seats are very comfortable even for a taller driver. Reclining rear seats accomodate taller rear seat riders well and the fuel mileage is a real plus. The 2.0 liter engine has plenty of power for this size car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my full size Ram to save on gas and provide the household with 2 cars for getting around. 1st bug! The check engine light has bad wiring and we are waiting on Dodge to send the replacement. 2nd bug! The model we bought has a Firestone tire that is not released to the public yet. and it is on back order and guessed it! We had a flat that could not be patched. So after 3 weeks we are waiting on a tire and a new wire so the check engine light will work correct. I hope nothing is wrong with the engine because the dealership just told us to drive it there is no problem!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall the car runs good and is fun to drive. Moving from a v8 to the 4 cylinder was a change but we like the pick up on the highway when we need it but we will not be racing anyone off the line! I love the way the dash lights up at night it is very easy on the eyes. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nice little car, if that's what you want to call it. The look sold us from the first, not crazy about the test drive, but wife like it and we drove it home. After 250 miles, got use to the CVT and small motor (I drive a F150 daily) and now use it to commute (wife has company car so don't get mad at me). The CVT makes driving fun again, MPG is very good also, running about 29 for us so far. Great for the money expecally for frist year model, usually they work out bugs after year 1, but Dodge did a good job with this one. If I have to sum the Caliber up in one word, it would be fun. Fun to drive, ride in, look at, just a feel good car. Even the color we bought, orange, is fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look, not cute, not brute. Those cool cup holders, adjustable arm rest and seat. Just the overall "feel" is great. Go for the 17" tires, way cool. Fog lights are nice as well.

For a 4 cylinder it is very quick and does not bog at all on takeoff. The gas mileage is definitely a plus!</TEXT>

It took a little getting used to the CVT transmission but now that I understand it, I like it even more. Power is there when I need it. The interior is really nice. Different. The exterior is funky. But a nice funky. I have a red Caliber and I am literally a driving bill board for this car. Everyone wants to know more about it. Great job, Dodge</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a dodge caliber used with only 19,000 miles in Feb. 2008. In June 2008 i noticed my car makeing a knocking noise when accelerateing or slowing down at this time the car only had 33,000 miles on it so it was still covered under warranty. So I took it to a dodge dealer here in this area and they checked it out and told me there was nothing wrong with it. I didn't agree so i took it to another dodge dealer the next week and they said nothing was wrong with it. So i gave up and of course the warranty went out and it is still making that noise well i took it to another mechnic and he told me that it was the transmission. And I'm a single mother and i cant afford $2500 to fix it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car brand new. I regret this purchase everyday. Since it's purchase I have had nothing but problem. It's needed new struts, tie- rod ends, has electrical issues, tires are shot after 20,000 miles, and at 30,000 the starter and relay is bad! This is just a bad car!!! If it would do me any good....I'd park it right in front of the bank!! No need for the repo man....I'm giving this one a special delivery!! Big ticket item with BIG PROBLEMS! Dodge went wrong on this one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car from enterprise. After the 1st week i needed a new transmission.(miles 34,000) 2 weeks later i need another transmission. Now i need a new engine because some rod broke. Worst car ever. Engine stalls when im on the highway. I bought it for $12,000. I tried to sell it back to enterprise and they will only give me $5,000. They said the Cailber doesn't hold its value. So after 2 months it lost $7,000.00. Im stuck with it. I should have bought the charger!!!! STAY CLEAR FROM THIS CAR!! DO NOT BUY!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2007 Caliber SXT (CVT, 2.0L) used with 1700 miles. It now has 15000 miles and zero problems. It's quiet at highway speeds and doesn't produce headache inducing sounds as the CVT keeps the rpms relatively low. Try driving a Honda Fit at 75 mph and you'll wish you were hard of hearing. Sharp looking car. I like the design of the interior, but way too much plastic. I guess the plastic makes since if Dodge was going after a rugged SUV/truck feel. Seats are very comfortable. Look up the TSB for the reprogram of the CVT. Being yours into the dealer and complain about sluggish performance. (They won't do a reprogram if you don't say there's a problem) Big difference!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the SXT model with a 2.4L 4- CYL with CVT for a month now and I love it! It's a solid, all-around car. For the money, it's a fantastic value! Some folks will point out that it doesn't perform as well as some of the other "hot hatches" but unless you're going R/T, you're not buying this to blow people off the road! It's got great cargo space, well thought out features, decent gas mileage, performs well in slippery conditions and snow. Infinity Stereo is great! Yeah, Dodge went a bit overboard on the Interior Plastic but hey, it's durable. Love the Exterior Styling and it is very quiet. Also, is it a coincidence that Toyota is trumpeting the new Venza? Looks a LOT like the Caliber!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've own this car since March 2007 and had a first great year, that's it! Ever since my car have been to the dealership almost every month. I had and still have the squeak sound in the back suspension, the mechanics seem to be clueless about it even after they changed from the chock to the bushings and some other things then the was and still is something weird. When I start the car, the RPM rev up and down about 5 seconds and if I try to put it in reverse the motor just stops and it's hard to start it again and I have to wait until the car warms up about 15 mins to be able to leave and sometimes the motor even totally stops at a red light.</TEXT>

It handles well in the snow, this was one of the major reasons I chose this car. It doesn't have any problems starting on those below zero mornings. I make long trips regularly and this car helps me get through them. The seats are very comfortable. The only problems I have had were there when I purchased. The cruise control was never hooked up correctly and one speaker didn't work right (which there was a recall on so I got all 4 replaced).

<TEXT>Now I'm a fussy car guy and this is the wife's car. I like the smooth CVT. It is a crossover so it's higher with all that that brings to handling. The car feels big on the road which is good, and bad. Previous car PT Cruiser. This has a smaller engine, more pep, and better gas mileage - what's not to like? It doesn't have as much storage or clever nooks as the Cruiser. It is very smooth around town and is great for running errands but Firestone tires are noisy - can't wait to change them out. Good gas mileage. Overall - funky new design. Are there better dynamics out there - yes, but this is crossover. Is it better than a SUV - yes. Bang for the buck = excellent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We decided to "downsize" from a Pacifica. Decided on the R/T AWD with a few extras like the driver convenience package (which we like -- compass, outside temp, etc.). Even with the extras, a great value. CVT takes a little getting used to, but the autostick is kind of fun. We like the exterior styling, with a higher stance than most cars its size. Only criticism is that the 6 disc CD changer doesn't have the MP3 mini- jack, so I'll have to get an FM modulator. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The interior is very thoughtfully designed and of good quality materials (thanks MB). I traded in a 2001 Volvo V70 on this and am happy with the exchange. I can't comment on reliability yet, but have high hopes. I have the CVT and must point out that many people hate them, thinking they're sluggish. They take an entirely different behavior to drive properly, first and foremost being: do NOT feather the gas! It gives decent acceleration performance once you understand its behavior. My only complaints are some wind noise above 35 and the seat is a bit high for me - I'm 6'7", so anyone can fit in this.</TEXT>

Frankly, I was starting to fear the car was going to fly apart. The dealership service kept telling me it was the tires making the noises, and I told them 'You let me drive it off the lot like this' I took it to Firestone and they said the tires were fine, numerous times. Come on! If I had needed tires, I reckon Firestone would have wanted to make a buck or two. Anywho, I wouldn't recommend the Caliber. Too bad, I thought it was going to be a pretty good car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded an 05 Liberty due to poor gas mileage. Not much better with this unless you have a tailwind or don't use the A/C or defrost. All 4 tires worn on inner tread at 20,000 miles. Dealer told me Chrysler would not do anything about it but I was welcome to call them. Had the dealer diagnose the problem and found 3 of 4 wheels out of alignment along with the trust angle. Told Chrysler they will fix it and replace the tires or I will never buy another Mopar. Scheduled to be fixed in 4 days.

<TEXT>This car will not make it to 100k. Electrical problems, battery will go dead for no reason. Terrible acceleration due to very poor CVT. Gas mileage suffers. Because of it you need to go deeper on the gas pedal to get up to speed. In shop for numerous repairs only has 30k miles on it. In shop now because a coolant leak from the engine not the radiator or hose but a main pipe that leads to the engine has to be checked out to see if new engine is needed. Terrible blind spots. Check plastic in trunk scratches and scuffs very easy. I won't be surprised at all if people that previously reviewed the car good need to come update it. Now I see why they need a bailout this being one of the reasons. I own 97 Camry with 200k miles less problems than this car at 30k </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm reading the reviews here and getting nervous about the transmission. For the last several fuel fill-ups, the car doesn't accelerate properly. It'll go, then there's a noticeable loss of power upon acceleration, then go, while my RPMs are all over the place. Usually, after getting gas, I'll have to pull over and re-tighten the gas cap (it looks like I have OCD at the pump... putting the cap on over and over, until I feel like I have a good seal). This morning (at 55k) my check engine light came on for no reason (haven't refueled in days). I'd like nothing more than to get the light to turn off, and trade it in before I'm out 4+k. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving Chrysler products for many years because I find them more reliable. I chose the 2007 Dodge Caliber after I tried out Matrix and others and notice the structure was much safer looking and it had a 5 star rating and it felt more like a safer car to ride in. After reading of so many being injured and killed in Toyota and other small cars I chose the Caliber and I'm glad I did. The ride is unbelievable, performance and economy better than expected. I usually trade every two years but this one's a keeper for another year or two. Compare the structure of this vehicle with Japan's vehicles and you will feel safe in a Caliber </TEXT>

<TEXT>I went with a smaller vehicle for gas reasons. I find myself putting $40-$50 a week in this car. I think it was over-rated when they put the gas mileage on the vehicle. I also had it in the shop for road noise,"the tires were deflated to put into showroom, and never were inflated for me at pick- up". It still sound like a mac truck from the inside, it is so loud that I can't even hear a siren when its behind me. I have to turn the radio up loud to just cover up the road noise. I really wished I had shopped around more before purchasing this vehicle. It rides like a lumber wagon!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Caliber is now in the shop because I need a new transmission. I have 30,000 miles on the car. I thank God that it is still under warranty. I bought it before the new warranty of 100,000 miles. I am thinking about selling it and buying something other than a Dodge. I like the car but I can't afford for this to happen again since my warranty will be over soon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive 130 highway miles every day. I bought the caliber because I needed an economical car with awd. The CVT is awful! At 50k, something was wrong. I took it in to the dealer and found out it needed a new tranny. A new tranny at 50k miles! I bought the car 4 months before Chrysler offered the lifetime warranty. With labor and tax, I was looking at $4000. The dealer wouldn?t do anything. They even told me that my caliber was not the first that they replaced the transmission in. I decided to call Chrysler for help. After 3 hours on the phone, I was able to convince them to pay for it. Never buy a vehicle with CVT. I will never buy a Chrysler vehicle again. Spend the extra money and get a Toyota or Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are considering this vehicle make sure that you check out all of the competition first! My main motive for purchasing this car was price as I was eligible for the employee discount. I got the 1.8 with manual trans, because I just don't trust CVTs to hold up for the long run. After 28k miles the exterior plastic is fading, the mileage is awful, and it still has a problem stalling at random (not driver induced, it often happens in neutral.) Perhaps all these problems are due to it being a first run year, but either way I would be weary.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a Volvo man - have owned 7 over the years (still own a 1994 940. I recently bought my first Dodge and am extremely happy with it. The reason I looked at the Caliber is I am a wheelchair user (manual, non-folding ultralight weight) and I have found that most new cars on the market are either too small to hold my wheelchair (without taking it apart), are huge gas guzzlers, or are too expensive for my budget. The Caliber will hold my wheelchair, gets great gas mileage, and is one of the least expensive new cars I have ever bought. It totally satisfies my requirements, is fun to drive and the dealer/service department is excellent. I highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After reading quite a few of these reviews, the common theme is tire issues. I, too, have been told that my tires need to be replaced. I have been told that it could be because of my alignment, suspension, tire pressure, you name it!! It just seems odd that a lot of people seem to have this issue. Chrysler won't do anything, sent me to Firestone, who sent me back to the dealership. Not good!! Very poor customer service. When are they going to take the hint and look into what is causing the problem?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this as a used fleet car at 16,000 miles. It's the 2.0 CVT SXT. I have had no problems thus far. The tires have been changed eliminating any road noise. AC is cold at 30 degrees lower than outside temp, chillzone stays at 65 to 75 degrees with ac on and vent open. I replaced the stock speakers but left the stock radio. I get avg. 28 city/ 32 highway mpg. Plenty of spunk for stop lights and city traffic dodging. Handles well, and will spin tires. Doesn't haul butt, 0-30 in 3 seconds and 30-60 in another 9 seconds. But, it is a clean looking car that's fun to drive with acceptable mpg and features. The new 2008s have more standard features now, but I'm glad to own an original.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a small car for by wife and test drove several. All most bought a new Chevy HHR. Went by the Dodge dealer and saw a program 07 Caliber. This vehicle had the most comfortable seats and drove better also the most fun to drive. I bought a 07 Sebring as well which is a great car but I like driving the Caliber more. It has more of a fun factor. The seats are a lot more comfortable as well. The CVT tranny makes the 2.0 quick of the line. The CVT is different from a standard automatic but that is not a bad thing. Road noise is about average for small car. The MPG is good. My friend bought a new VW Rabbit and he likes the Caliber better than his new car. I recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a new left over 2007 Caliber in March of 2008. I had the car a week when I hit a deer. The car broke like a plastic toy. The front end was completely smashed, the car was not drivable with broken parts and debris covering the roadway. The damage $10,000 and I only hit a deer! The Dodge dealer has had my car since March 17, 2008 and I have been driving a rental for 3 months because Dodge will not release the parts. The local Dodge dealer has been super. My insurance stopped paying after 30 days and the Dodge dealer is picking up the remainder. I am extremely disappointed with the Customer service and support or lack of it provided by the manufacturer!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AVOID THIS CAR! The Caliber replaced the Dodge Neon. That should tell you something. As a comparison the Ford Mustang gets better gas mileage. My rental is a Mazda 3.

The only thing my dealership had to say to me was, "I hope you purchased good life insurance." I have taken more time off work and lost so much money because of it and they can't or won't even fix the car. They always have an excuse saying they can't find the problem.

<TEXT>We bought this car because of the size and as a winter driver thought it would be safer than the PT Cruiser I had previously. After having the car a month I had to have the front end worked on. At 24,000 miles I have been told I have to replace all 4 tires as the make is not a "good tire for the car." 18 inch tires are $200 each. Also I purchased the extended service for oil changes for the life time of the car and the dealer has gone out of service. Dodge will not honor the contract. My review is: the car is a waste of good money and as a Dodge product I find it sadly lacking in comfort, gas mileage and most of all service through the Dodge dealers. SAD CAR!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased one of the first Calibers available. We knew we were purchasing an inexpensively built car so high expectations for quality of the interior and ride were not a factor. It was a sharp, fun, inexpensive car. The fuel rating also sold us and is the only negative we have. We have driven the car 24,000 miles now and the typical overall mileage is around 23 mpg even though the "city" low rating is 26. This was a severe misstatement by Dodge. I have owned several new cars and trucks over my 35 years of driving and have always gotten at least the minimum reported mileage that was disclosed.

I have 12,000 miles now, starting around 6,000 was a thumping noise. Apparently all four tires are bad and Firestone won't warranty them, Dodge just denies it's the car! Also, poor design (when you roll down the rear windows, the car shakes so bad, it hurts your ears, sounds like a helicopter on the roof) Also do not like the rubbery plastic interior. Once you bump into it with something, big scratch! Also hate the white ceiling and its fabric. Passenger heated seat hardly warms up. Overall, getting more and more unhappy!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this as a daily commuter vehicle averaging about 100 miles round trip. The interior was making noise from the vibration upon acceleration. I applied clear silicone to where the plastic touched metal and this seemed to stop. The car is not insulated very well and the cabin is very noisy at highway speeds. The pickup is horrible. I expected more from the 177 HP engine. The gas gauge is screwy and no where near accurate. When the light goes on you better get gas quick! Although there were plenty of places to put things it seemed as though I never had enough room. I traded this car in @ 22K miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At 20K miles the road noise was deafening and we noticed the passenger rear tire was warn down to the tread markers. Upon evaluation, we were told that we needed to purchase 4 new tires. We were not given any explanation as to why we were being held responsible for the worn tires. Some research revealed that we are not the only ones with this issue. Chrysler sent us to Firestone. Firestone engineers, said that the tire specified by Chrysler is softer and does not qualify for any tread warranty. The Firestone told me that Chrysler knows that the tires are no good after 12K to 15K miles. Chrysler refuses to help. The only resolution is buy new tires. Apparently, once a year.</TEXT>

It has 4 doors but absolutely no room in the back unless you have the seat tilted so far back you look at the ceiling. The windows are so hard to look out of the visibility sucks. The mileage on the car runs about 26 mpg if we are lucky. The only good point is that it is very good in the snow.</TEXT>

Traction, brake force, and cornering is awesome with her. Interiors are great, I don't have the musicgate sound system, just stick with the four speaker system that sounds better than any car in its category, with an extremely deep bass, and high treble there is no need for an upgrade.

<TEXT>I purchased my 2007 AWD R/T used with 11,000 miles. I enjoy the slap shift tranny and it's great in bad weather. Simply downshift instead of breaking and it stays straight and stops well. Interior is very compfortable for four adults. Reclining rear seats a plus. Can't hook up my Ipod - bummer! Add the shock tower support for a more solid feel - it works great and reduces cowl shake on bumps plus improves cornering. Over all I am enjoying the call a lot. Average mileage for city is 22 mpg on the highway over 27. Not bad for all wheel drive. If I shift manually it is great fun to drive as well. I recommend the 2.4L engine for improved performance.

<TEXT>I have had my Caliber SXT for 3 months and 8000 miles now. I get lots of comments on it's looks, and the aluminum rims really add to it. Keeping in mind the price, we love it! The musicgate sound system has amazing bass and power. It has a very smooth ride for a "small car". When stopped, we can not even feel the engine running, as there is no miss or vibration! The chilled glove box is a nice feature. The gas mileage has not been what I hoped for at around 24mpg with a lot of highway miles, but it has been winter driving. Winter handling has been impressive so far. I highly recommend the Caliber to anyone looking for a new car in the mid/upper teens price range.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a good commuter car. I bought it because it seems the car best balancing gas mileage and interior space. I'm on the tall side at 6'4". It is slow and handles poorly when pressed, but I don't dirve that way. The tubing covering the break lines has dropped down 4 times and the dealer does not seem to have a solution. I had to fix it. The steering wheel controls for the radio/cd player have a mind of their own. The left button that should change the stations only does that occasionally. Mostly it lowers or raises the volume randomly. I no longer us it. I don't know that I'd buy this one again, but I'm not terribly dissatisfied either. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car reminds me of the Volkswagon Jetta, people kept them for years. The only difference is that the Caliber is a lot bigger and roomier. If you get the 5-speed, manual transmission and the 1.8L engine, you won't have any acceleration problems and you'll get great milleage. I get over 400 miles per tank (13.5 gallons) city and highway average. If you get the fold-down front seat option you've got a vehicle for car camping. The car has a lot of front leg room; I'm 6'5" tall and I am very comfortable (when the seat is all the way back, there probably isn't a lot of rear leg room.

<TEXT>This car is great on dry roads, but I am extremely unhappy with the tires. I had to replace all after 17000 miles, and do not think they are good winter snow tires like I am used to from my previously owned Subaru. Maybe this problem will be corrected with a demand for a better all-season tire. I hit a deer with the center front. We had over 2000 in damages, but my 87 year old aunt in the passenger seat wasn't even jarred! Really dislike the hatch system and how you have to readjust the dash lights every time you start the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a little scared about the traction during bad weather. I had stopped at a red light, and it was raining, when I started go forward after the light had change the wheels on the car started to spin. Now that I have this car I feel that the safety rate on this car, should be re-rated again. It's scary to be behind another car at a car length behind and all of a sudden the car in front of you make a sudden stop. I think that this car should be a re- call.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased a Caliber for my wife in April. Looks decent on the outside, interior leaves a little to be desired. Several times the check engine light came on, ended up being some air/fuel sensor that blew almost on a weekly basis. When it did, the gas mileage went from 30MPG to literally about 8MPG. That was a pain the butt with gas prices. Dodge took care of it, no questions asked. The only other problem we have noticed is the gas pedal is a little sensative. When you push it, there is either a delay or it guns it. With my wife being pregnant, that can be annoying when it jerks her.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Transmission is extremely smooth. Very responsive steering, easy on tires.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had the car for about a month. Great radio/CD system but do not understand why there is no aux. imput. Car pull slightly to the left so I am having dealer look at alignment. AWD drive cars go out of alignment easily and chew up tires. Fuel economy is 22- 24 mpg in commuting,slightly better on highway, but no AWD car will match a two wheel drive car in mpg. The CVT seems to do better at mpg in city driving. Pick-up could be better. I would recommend that Dodge consider the Turbo-Diesel used in Europe ( 220 foot pounds of torque ) or a 30 hp upgrade to the 2.4 using a milder version of the SRT turbo. Have not driven in snow yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased 2007 R/T in Oct. Have put 3600 miles on it and so far it's been great. Looked at and drove a Chevy HHR,Pontiac Vibe, and the Caliber won out hands down. Must have got a good one, so far. Have had no problems and gas mileage has gone from 27.5 to 30.5 since new. I drive a 100 miles a day so fuel economy means a lot.Wish I could have gotten a 5 or 6 speed but was told manual was not offered in the R/T FWD. The CVT is a little goofy but once you get used to it, it;s ok.Space is excellent. We have a Newfoundland and the woman who taught doggie obedience class has a Caliber and highly recommened it.She was right. So far very pleased.Dog fits in fine. Comfortable drivers position. Love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, roominess with back seats folded down. Satellite radio, controls on steering wheel and drivers controls are a plus. Style-turns a lot of heads. Get the Black with grey & red interior. Really sharp. Lighted cup holders pretty cool. 18inch wheels, great rims. Overall a very sharp looking car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm usually not a "small" car guy, but the Dodge Caliber gives me everything I was looking for. Fuel mileage is a plus, and I still feel like I'm in an SUV. I buy a new car every couple of years. This is the first new car I have purchased that I have not had any mechanical complaints with. Usually, when I buy a new car, there are noises or just something that stands out that concerns me about future reliability. This car just does what I want it to do...start every time and drive without little glitches.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the CVT transmission and the well-lighted interior displays.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love my Dodge Caliber. Driving on the autobahn is a blast. When it get to about 110mph it can cruise at lease 110 to 120mph. Love it. Germans keep asking what kind of car is it. They dont know the dodge sign and the style is like a BMW Crossover SUV. So overall I am happy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I would say Ipod holder. Cupholders and glovebox refridgeration used it in the summer it works but only when ac is on. Once at a good speed has no problem keeps up on the Autobahn.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my R/T AWD for almost two years now. It has about 27,000 miles on it currently. I like it but it does have faults. Road noise is one big one, and blind spots. You have to be very careful when changing lanes with this car! Other than that, it looks great when it's clean (black shows everything)!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo system..it's excellent! Styling, both interior and exterior Value, a lot of features for the price</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I first bought my car I loved it. Every day I grow to love it even more. The versatility of this vehicle is awesome. I love the fact that there is so much plastic in the car, it allows me to clean up after the kids. This is the solution to the minivan, for young hip moms.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After many recommendations from the in-laws I purchased a Dodge Caliber. All-in-all I'm horribly disappointed. The best drive I've had was the test drive. Terrible fuel economy relative to other like-sized vehicles. Noisy on all but the smoothest paved roads. Concrete highways were a nightmare. I can't recommend the vehicle on any level.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice body style, decent room, very nice transmission.</FAVORITE>
