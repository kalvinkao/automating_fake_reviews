<TEXT>I just moved to Germany two months ago and bought an 07 MDX from another military member. It has everything I could want. We just returned from a week driving through the Alps and this SUV is simply amazing. Granted, I get to drive it much faster than I could in the states, but even at 120 MPH, it was rock solid. We need the AWD for the snow and the kids stay entertained with the AV system. Plenty of passing power and very comfortable on long trips. Acuras are rare in Germany and I get stares all the time by curious Bavarians wondering what kind of vehicle I have. If you are in the market for a luxury SUV for family touring, with cool tech toys to play with, MDX can't be beat. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The separate controls for the rear passengers are awesome. I can control temp and AV from the front or switch to rear. Sound system is amazing. I will sometimes sit in the driveway and just listen. Also has a 120v outlet in console. Great for us since we live with 220v and need 120 on occasion. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After months of careful research and test drives at BMW, Lexus, Volvo, etc. I settled on the MDX without a doubt in mind. I love the way the car handles, no stiffness or resistance in the steering or acceleration. The interior design is a little Star Trek for me, but once I figured everything out, it is a pleasure to have all the extras (XM radio, navigation, Bluetooth, backup camera, etc.)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The self-adjusting side mirrors which rotate to give you a view of the curb/lines as you back up. Makes backing into parking spaces and parallel parking a breeze, along with the back-up camera. Also a fan of the push-to-talk for my cell phone.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm two years into a three year lease and I love this car. The only thing I would change would be the shape of the grill...THAT'S IT. Everything else is perfect. Great performance, plenty of power and AWD when skiing, plenty of room for baggage, great MPG for an SUV, navi system is far superior to GM's Suburban (don't have to put in park to change your destination, etc). Zero problems...just gas and oil changes. One beautiful car...except for the sho-gun shield looking grill.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navi is easy, hands-free is great, AWD is perfect.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First luxury crossover SUV I have owned. MDX won out over the Lexus, and cost less for a very well equipped base package. Handling, power and ride are outstanding. Back seats are a little less comfortable for my tall teenagers. Back cargo area is very roomy, and easily expandable with 3rd seat folded and back seats down. I drive up snowy, often treacherous mountain canyons to ski in the winter. The SH-AWD system, coupled with the manual shift mode (for descents), is outstanding. The MDX is much better in the snow than 3 truck base SUVs, I have owned previously. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Japanese SUV we have had in a while. Last SUV's were Yukon XL and Envoy XL. This beats them out by far. Performs almost as well as our Mercedes e class but has the utility of our Envoy. We always take this on trips and it is very comfortable. The third row is great for smaller children but not so much for adults. Best SUV so far. No problems within our almost 2 years ownership.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my MDX for about 1 1/2 yrs & have loved every minute of driving the 24k problem free miles on it! It is so much fun to drive; looks & feels luxurious so no problem pulling up to upscale places! I didn't want to give up space to pop things in the back and go so I keep the third seat down & purchased the rubber mat for the back. I have plenty of room while at the same time I am "zippy"; easily pulling into parking spaces and getting around town. I love the navigation system, although it does need updating and the bluetooth is wonderful, although for some reason it keeps unhooking my Treo phone which the Acura people say is the phone's fault. LOVE IT & would buy it again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Large storage area, hands free phone with the bluetooth & voice recognition is safe. The heaviness of it feels safe and large interior is very comfortable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is a fun SUV to drive. The engine is smooth, the white lights are super bright, the sound system is amazing and it does not feel like a big car behind the wheels. It handles amazingly well in the snow and would likely recommend it to anyone. I just went through a B1 service, oil change and tire rotation, which cost me $56. It seems fair compared to the maintenance on the Audi. We do a lot of highway driving and average 19 MPG and it took about 7500 miles before the service light came on. We have an Accord and Honda USA treated us well. We got rid of our Audi and went with a Honda product. We made the right choice. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD. Excellent car for winter driving. Sound system is great. The best GPS system that I used. It is a good size SUV but it does not feel big behind the wheel and blind spot is minimal. Backup camera is a must. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm a realtor in Colorado and went up to Whale Rock Road in Bellvue to list a home. The owner said I would need chains to get up and down the hills. I took a chance and drove up the hill without any issues, used the manual transmission to drive down the switch backs and snowy, icey hills to "civilization" and the car basically drove me down. When I would've shifted it was already where I wanted it. I generally do not drive off-road and was amazed at the handling capability. This car is quiet, comfortable and stylish with plenty of room. (Love the storage and 3rd row seat when needed). I'm thrilled I have the MDX! Thank you Acura you have a fan, who is living to talk about it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>In love with this car! Gorgeous interior, heavy tech features without the heavy price! Did a 7 hour road trip with family. Wife was in back seat reclined back enjoying a movie with our son while I was listening to ESPN XM radio up front. We had their temp set to 78 as they are always cold and I was feeling good around 72 degrees since I am always warm... very nice!! Excellent acceleration and handling. Previous review said they had heavy steering. I do not have this problem at all. This vehicle has surpassed our expectations and I would be very suprised if it doesn't win a lot of awards!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently picked up my 2007 tech and entertainment MDX on 2-23-07. It has been truly a great purchase. I traded in a 2006 Mercedez-Benz that had multiple problems to an upgraded dream. All of the technology is great. I offer to drive my friends around just so I can feel the comfort of the seats. I am a stay home mom with 2 kids. This car has plenty of room for everyone. I highly recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got the MDX. Love it. It is such a great car for me. I have owned two Hondas in the past (civic and accord) and wanted another Honda but wanted more luxury than the Pilot. So the Acura was the answer. It's a great ride, everything I need. I'm a 5'1 female and I love it. I have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did, little guy can get in easier by himself and I use it to buckle him in without stretching.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my 07 MDX for about 2 months now, I love the thing from its fun to drive to its looks. Only problem was a loose rear suspension bolt that made noise over some bumps. Dealer took care of that and now its as solid as anything out there. Fuel economy isnt all that great in the city but on the highway its very good. Its a new design so only time will tell what the recalls will be if any. But so far with 2000 miles on it its great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded in my 2002 MDX for the New 2007 MDX and am about to trade again! The new car is significantly smoother to drive except the steering is so heavy it feels as if your are driving a truck 3 times heavier. The whole driving experience is that of a much larger car then the old one, but when I get out and look at it, it looks much smaller then the replaced MDX. My wife actually has a hard time parking in small parking lots because of the steering. This is a big negative. The build quality is superb and there are lots of improvements, but be warned the driving experience is anything but nimble.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent vehicle. Took it on a cross country trip from CA to NY with absolutely no problems. With highway driving, I get close to 23 mpg, but when driving around town, I usually get about 15 (I drive pretty aggressively I guess). Build quality and design is superb, and the options you get for the price compared to cars in its class is considerable. Only thing that I'd really like to see are flat 2nd row seats, for better cargo storage. But otherwise, excellent :D! I love my car. I've gotten about 5500 miles on it so far in 2 months.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, although I haven't gotten the voice commands down yet, I feel I'll love it more once I do get that. Bluetooth connection for the phone is super cool. And people always seem interested with the small storage space near the passenger's feet. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As expected, Acura's attention to detail, outstanding quality and impeccable ergonomics live on. The overall interior quality is terrific. Love the handling prowess. Takes curves like a sports sedan - well, almost. Very good power once over 30 mph. Very smooth suspension compliance but so much that wallowing and pitch/rolls dominate; spot on blend of comfort and handling. Additionally, the navigation system is terrific and easy to use. The upgraded stereo system is awesome, and the rear view camera is great. Leather, sunroof and all the bells and whistles I could want. Comparably equipped X5 was $14K higher - no budging. Bottom line - best SUV available under $50K! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior layout, ergonomics and sporty handling. ELS sound system is beautiful. Vault-like quietness; almost sound-proof.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>MDX Dad</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I was looking for a vehicle for my wife and daughter. I am the kind of guy that will research vehicles for months and months before making a decision. After comparing the MDX with just about every luxury suv (ie, X5, XC90) on the market, the decision became easy. The MDX has a luxurious feel but still has a lot of function to the design. The technology is amazing and easy to get used to (my wife is not a tech geek at all and she is loving the nav, blue tooth, rear view camera, etc.). Very safe vehicle. After all the research I am convinced this is the SUV of the year, when luxury, quality, performance, and Acura's reliability are all thrown together. Best vehicle we have ever owned!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love the look. Not at all generic like a lot of crossover SUVs!! We got the ENT/Tech with desert rock metallic and parchment interior. Wife loves it!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Resisted at first but since it was the vehicle that my wife would be driving then it was pretty much her decision. And her decision was just that. Lets go buy the MDX. Now I am a convinced owner of all the quality and comfort Acura has to offer (which if you let my wife tell the story she already knew). It is by far the most superior vehicle we have owned. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The luxury/sport button. In our quest to find the color and package that we wanted we were told by many different sales reps that the difference was minute. How wrong they were. You can tell a huge difference. I love the sport and my wife is all for the luxury. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With the exception of gas mileage, the new MDX exceeds my expectations - handling on par with best sport sedans, very quiet, rides better than most luxury cars. Build quality very good. Improved overall from an excellent 2001 MDX. Trip computer very inaccurate - overstates mpg by at least 10%. MPG an actual 20.5 for 2000 mile trip, primarily interstate at 70-75 mph. Surround sound system is excellent, perhaps better than my '04 Acura TL. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Compared with Mercedes ML350, Lexus 350, BMW X5 3.0, Volvo XC90. Better than the ones compared to. With Mercedes and BMW everything is an option. I had a MB S430. I spent too much time repairing the vehicle. MDX comes fully loaded with all options. The audio system is excellent. It plays MP3s of DVDs. It can hold 6+1 DVDs loaded with MP3. 7 * 8.4 GB (dual layer) = approx 60GB of songs... AMAZING !! Quality of audio is also excellent. Navigation rocks. MB navigation is like Mickey Mouse compared to this. I never thought of being so happy of a Honda over the MB.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the 2001 MDX Touring when it was first available. Kept it for a couple years and traded it on a Nissan Titan. Now I am back with the 2007 MDX. Wow is all I can say. It's more refined than I remember the 2001. I bought the Tech Package and I love all the gadgets. The leather seems to be better quality. This one seems quieter than the 1st gen.

The electronics integration is perfect, as per Acura's usual standard. The driving experience is just beyond reproach for a vehicle with this size and flexibility. The SH-AWD system with the sport package suspension gives you a great combination of pull through curves, precise handling and a smooth ride with the benefit of the sport suspension's active dampers. You can carry lots of people and/or stuff and have a whole lot of fun doing it!! This '07 MDX is truly as good as it gets!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded my beloved Infiniti FX for this MDX Sport. I drove the Acura just to prove to myself that my FX was still unrivaled in the world of upscale crossover vehicles. You gotta understand I loved my FX, but I loved my childhood sweetheart too and then I started meeting real women. Yikes!!! The MDX Sport handles better than top of the line Porsche of my 70s youth. While not the briskest off the line, from 4000 rpm and above this beast will compare favorably with almost anything not in the "super car" category. The blend of technology (too much to tell you about), comfort, utility, fit and finish is unrivaled. Drive one, hear one, and make one go around a corner... then decide.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my MDX for about a month now; traded in my 2000 Grand Cherokee. While I don't think this has the off-road capabilities of the Jeep, how often are you really "off-road"? (Once in 7 years for me). The front seats are extremely comfortable and the ride is one of the smoothest I've ever had. Had a big snowstorm recently and I would classify the performance as "decent, but not great." I considered the Q7, XC90 and 4Runner as well. For the price, you cannot beat the standards in the MDX anywhere. Thought about upgrade to to Tech pkg, but expensive and will probably just get aftermarket Nav at some point for way cheaper.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wife and I were in market for vehicle with 3rd row of seating. We don't like the large truck-like SUVs and also do not like minivans. We decided to look into the luxury SUV segment and narrowed our choices to the BMW X5, Volvo XC90, LandRover LR3, and the Acura MDX. After test driving all and reviewing the numbers, the MDX was the obvious choice. Unbelievable extras for the money. When compared with these other luxury SUVs, I would have had to pay around $60K to get the same amount of features. Acura navigation currently head and shoulders above competition. Love the combination of luxury, utility, and convenience. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have about 1,300 miles so far and do enjoy it. Tested RX 330, XC90, Touraeg and this is it. Acceleration a little touchy at start, maybe software upgrade to transmission needed. Ride is excellent, super quiet, luxurious interior. I purchased base model and has great features for price point. Mileage about 19 mpg with mostly suburb driving. Mine came with Bridgestone Dueler tires with B/B rating, I would expect best quality for this vehicle. You get Mich. A/A when you buy other trim lines. Shame on you Acura. Telescopic steering wheel could go another inch, I'm 6'1" just to be safe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took the car from the dealer then drove 2000 miles over the past 3 weeks. Fuel average is 20.1. More quiet, comfortable & fun to drive than the 2004 I traded in. Great sound system. NAV has greatly improved. Really need to read the driving manual. Tried Lexus RX 350 and BMW X5 but preferred the MDX ride, features & price. Miss the automatic windshield wipers & hope I never need to replace the "blue" headlights. Highly recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the car for only 6 weeks, and I have experienced the following problems. The right front door started to rattle the next day after delivery. After the door was fixed, the sunroof and the front passenger seat started to rattle. After these were fixed, the dashboard started to rattle. The AC compressor makes a loud thump when it starts, and it can repeat the start-and- stop cycle several times when you wait for the green light. The transmission makes knocking noises when both speed and rpm are low as if it were a 10,000- mile-old transmission. The back of the car produces a click sound when any of the doors is shut closed. The last two problems also occurred in the loaner MDX I got.</TEXT>

<TEXT>About 3 weeks into my ownership, and I love the MDX so far. It is probably the most comfortable drive of any vehicle I have owned, including luxury sedans. I narrowed my choices to the MDX, Q7 and XC90 and the MDX won without too much thought. And the value is outstanding for what you are getting.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I told my wife the MDX had seating for 7, and she said we bought a minivan. I don't think so. With the more aggressive styling, and exceptional handling, this absolutely will not be confused with a van. While not in the SUV class of my old 4Runner, I've come to the conclusion my time spent off-roading is in the past. For the streets, you can't do better. The fit and finish is excellent, there is little road noise, and electronic capabilities (Nav, voice, and sound systems) of the car are outstanding. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After a couple of months, of trying to convince my wife to trade our 2004 Lexus GX 470, I finally wore her down and we (she) reluctantly bought the Acura. One of my concerns was moving "down" to an Acura from a Lexus. I was extremely wrong, this is one high tech machine, the navigation system offers more features, but is much more user friendly than the Lexus, The entertainment package gives the kids the option of listening to their choice through the headphones while the adults can listen to something different through the speakers & handling on this car is unbelievable. You can even set the doors to lock/unlock at the speed of your choice & the remote to open 1 or all doors w/ 1 touch. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Acura vehicle, I previously owned a BMW coupe & am a current owner of an Odyssey. I primarily got this vehicle because of the value that was packed into this model. Comparing it with a BMW X5 (07- 3.0), this was a much lighter vehicle, lower cost & easier to handle. The ride was also quiet and the seats are comfortable. The third row seats' leg/shoulder room is better than the competition. Middle row seats are very comfy for the two outer most, however the middle one is not good for long travel. The driver seat is excellent in holding the driver and power seats have lumbar support. The sound system rocks! Navigation is easy to use & voice commands are very convenient.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, sound system which supports DVD-A & MP3/WMA playback. Comfy seats for the first two rows. Bluetooth capability. Multi information display showing SH-AWD activity. 7 seats.

<TEXT>The car is just beautiful. I got the black cherry pearl sport, fully loaded. It's like being strapped into a rocket, what power and handling. The fuel consumption is higher than I expected but I was told that it would take several months before the true fuel consumption is realized, I hope that's true. I love XM and if you love music like I do, I would highly recommend getting the navigation just for this option. I haven't tried the sport driving feature yet and probably will not use much in the future. I got the sport just because of the upgrade in leather. The parchment interior looked too yellow, put with upgrade to sport, the leather looks much softer and not so yellow.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2007 MDX may be best car I've ever had. My previous cars were no slouches: BMW 540i (6-speed), M5, X5, and Infiniti FX-45. I loved all of them! This is very similar to X5 only leaves $20,000 in your pocket. This car has fantastic ride in comfort for most roads, and sports car handling on windy mountain byways. We love the voice controls for Nav, climate and stereo. Stereo is best short of Audi A8 which runs $8,000. If you can find one, buy it loaded! Taupe interior is gorgeous! Seats are sensational!

(17 MPG mixed hwy and city.) Very fun to drive. The navigation system is awesome. Easy to use and many features. Stereo system very impressive. Head lamps light the road very well at night. Seats are very comfortable and the heated seats work very well. 3rd row seats are OK. Great for kids or adults on short trips. The rear entertainment is very nice. Good screen and easy to operate.

<TEXT>Bought an aberdeen green the weekend before Thanksgiving and could not be more satisfied with it. Great power once you get the rpms up. The 5 speed should have been a 6, but it's not a deal killer at all. For me the transmission has taken a bit of time to get used to. I think it is geared more towards gas mileage until you get on it and then it really moves. Gas mileage has been between 18 & 19 mpg and that is mostly in town driving. Good for a 300 hp midsize suv. The lack of a dimming rear view mirror is no issue at all. The rear windshield is so dark that it is not necessary to buy the dimming mirror. Love the way the AC/fan speed adjusts based upon the location of the sun!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove the BMW X3, X5, owned the Honda Pilot 2006. Once I saw this new MDX I had to test drive it. The SH-AWD really is impressive. It corners under acceleration like nothing I've driven before. I'ved owned a couple BMWs and we just bought for my wife a 2007 328ci with sport suspension. I'm amazed at how well the MDX holds it's own with the little sports car as far as feel and road holding under extreme cornering. Brakes are great. The third row is nice in a pinch for small trips.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The SH AWD is outstanding in a class of it's own. The active damping system for suspension makes this SUV feel like a sports sedan. It really is very enjoyable to drive. Less road noise is much appreciated.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Finally a luxury SUV from Acura with good performance. I now have 1000 miles on my 07 and am very pleased with it. It has very comfortable front seats, handles very well for an SUV with good power and acceleration. I use the manual shifting capability a lot and find it very convenient to use. The sound system is excellent. When I first got the car I found myself accelerating to 70 mph to merge with 55mph highway traffic. Then I realized I wasn't hearing any noise associated with the speed and that's why I didn't realize how fast I was going. The Nav and Entertainment systems are excellent and easy to operate. The kids love the larger DVD screen. Thanks Acura for a great SUV!</TEXT>

Custom features impressive - you can design this car however you want. Sound system very nice, navi is the easist I've seen, although the voice commands are a little rough so far for me. Bluetooth is awesome, linked up my phone in minutes. Acceleration is solid, especially in the 60+ range. Averaged 20 MPG in freeway driving so far. Added roof rack - solid metal rack, and sport running boards as well as D/N mirror. Perfect family car. </TEXT>

The manual shift mode is fun. The driver's comfort and positioning with instruments and gear shift were well conceived. I would have liked to have had items in the entertainment package such as electric tail gait and heated second row seats. 3rd row seats are still cramped. Missing are the automatic wipers, and auto dimming mirror (which didn't work with the privacy glass in the rear). This is a thrilling car to drive and own.

<TEXT>A great car for those that need the third row but love to drive. What really sets the '07 apart for us is the handling on the Sport model. Power is good enough, interior is beautiful, exterior is nice in black. But this thing has fantastically controlled body motion, very little lean, good steering. And the SH-AWD really works, rotating the car even at moderate throttle. None of the ponderous SUV feel, understeer, etc. We are coming from a BMW 528i wagon with a sport suspension, and the MDX is very pleasant surprise. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very nice vehicle overall, but not outstanding. Acceleration (off-the-line) is not very strong and feels only very slightly better than my previous '02 MDX. Once it gets going (around 3500 RPM) the engine comes to life. Don't see all the hype about SuperHandling-AWD - much better than the old model, but not any better than others such as the new BMW X5. Ride comfort great with the Active dampers! and front seats are excellent! - but fuel economy is a big disappointment - only getting around 12mpg city and 18 mpg highway at 75mph.

<TEXT>Picked up this baby on 10/19/2006. Had returned my Lexus RX 330 lease that same day. Compared to the RX 330, the MDX is 6 inches wider, 4 inches longer, and 2 inches taller. But given the size and weight difference, the MDX is almost as nimble as the RX 330. (It definitely much more nimbler than the Mercedes ML class.) The ride is pretty good, but not in the class of the Lexus. If maximum comfort is what you seek, you can't beat a Lexus. Acuras are very German-like, they are built as performance vehicles first and foremost. Luxury/comfort comes behind. The GPS system and controls takes getting used to. (At least for me, because my RX 330 had touchscreen GPS, the MDX uses a turndial.)</TEXT>

Larger engine gives it a little more power but the interior fit and finish is the greatest part. Feels like a true cockpit and the Nav System was great. Far superior to the last model. Really enjoyed the XM radio and the sound system is fabulous. The new trip computer not quite as good as elapsed time resets with each stop rather than driver resetting it. Most features were easy to operate, very intuitive. Seats with lumbar support can't be beat and I tried them all. Thanks Acura.</TEXT>

This is a completely new model with zip and zest that will leave any man or woman feeling lucky to own. I'm glad I waited and didn't order something else more expensive; it was worth the wait.

This SUV has much less pick up than my 01 V8 Grand Cherokee which it replaced (I leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way too high rpm) - but slightly better gas mileage for a larger car (the onboard mile computer is off by the way). Rear camera takes 10 sec when backing up (making it much less useful). Also mismatching color bumper is tacky IMO for $45k car (I picked silver body which blends the best). Instrument cockpit is WAY too busy with DVD/nav system (and I'm a techy).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outside style, pretty interior, good value vs BMW X5/X3 I was also looking at. Beautiful car and we have 3 (!) in our cul de sac to prove it :)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2007 MDX just two days ago and LOVE it! It rides like a luxury SUV but with the kick and sporty attitude of a TL or TSX. The Technology Package blows my mind and I consider myself a "techy guy"! I am thrilled to have this vehicle! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Technology Package is by far my most favorite feature of the MDX. From the voice recognition to the rear view camera! It even imports your cell phone address book once you link the bluetooth connection. WOW!!! I also love the cabin as it is very quiet. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my 2007 MDX with/Tech pack in August 2007. Do not like it. The acceleration is sluggish, and the engine is noisy. The tech gadgets function well, but you have to take 20 hours to read the manual to learn how to use them. The navigation system comes with a very old map and POI database. You cannot find any place built after 2004. The navigation system also does not take latitude/longitude. The $3000 navigation system is not better than a $150 portable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Between Sept 2007 and April 2008 I had 3 sets of front tires, 2 sets of back tires and it drives worse than my Tacoma! I jumps from side to side over bumps. It's unpredictable on stopping. Honda Corp only tell me they can try and "have it fixed" It's been in 7 times in 8 months! I stopped driving it in June. Selling something to you that is broken then just "fixing it" is unethical.

<TEXT>First thing I want to say is that this SUV handles better than a vehicle this large and high should. Honda/Acura did a great job with the suspension and driver aids. The interior space is very nice. This car is wider than most of the competition so that translates into more passenger comfort when you have more than two passengers in the back seat. The third row is fine for kids or adults on short trips. I am disappointed in the gas mileage. In the city I am lucky to get over 12 mpg. On the highway I get about 19. Nowhere near the numbers advertised. I also find it pretty pathetic that a $40K+ vehicle has fake plastic wood. I have had panel gap issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall this is a great car. I've strictly driven Lexus for the past few years due to the quality and comfort of their cars/SUVs. This is my first foray with Acura. The MDX is a nice car that is easy to drive, although had I known I would only be getting 12.5 mpg around town, I probably would have purchased something else. Oh, and the back-up camera does not work well if too much light is shining on the back of the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned over a dozen Hondas and Acuras through the years. I must confess this is probably the best vehicle Honda has ever made, right up there with such ground breakers as the NSX and s2000. Honda has simply built an SUV version of the Acura RL. I should know since I also have an RL. In all but the most aggressive of handling maneuvers the MDX matches the RL. It's very quiet with a nice engine growl when revved. Acceleration is good for such a heavy vehicle. Rear comfort for 2 is excellent. The other 3 spots are for children. Cargo space is ample with the rear seat stowed, towing performance is excellent. Competitors may be better in one category or another, but overall none is even clo</TEXT>

I really miss the rain sensing wipers, the day/night mirror which is now finally included and the open bottom of the steering wheel to rest my hand on long trips. The ultimate insult is that darn Bluetooth. Company in the car just laugh at how bad it is when you cant understand people while driving over 40mph. So much for the "technology leader".</TEXT>

<TEXT>We picked up our MDX in June 2007. What a purchase! We compared all of the vehicles in the class and selecting this vehicle over all of the others from our perspective was a no- brainer. Here we are with over 10K miles and we just love this SUV. It is so fun to drive. We got everything on the vehicle. The technology pkg, the performance is unmatched. This vehicle has a powerful engine that truly delivers. We did the head to head test drives with the BMW X5, Porsche Cayenne and other top brand crossovers so the buying decision was very easy thereafter. It outperformed everything. Having had several Acuras in the past, the build quality is simply awesome. One test drive will sell this SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The technology package is very nice. Very roomy interior and quite luxurious inside. Lots of headroom and legroom. The audio system is exquisite. Switchable comfort/sport ride is awesome.

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle but... in the 8 months I have owned it Acura had to replace the windshield (flaw causing distortion), adjust 2 of the door handles (installed wrong), replace the muffler (broken interior baffle), replace a rear strut (failed), replaced the battery (dead cell), fix the dash and trim (installed incorrectly) and other minor items. Mine has had horrible build quality, although my dealer is fantastic. I bought Acura because we have had great cars from Honda, but this isn't built nearly as well as my wife's Odyssey. But, no SUV out there drives this well. If you are considering, buy the SPORT, it's worth the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth is FANTASTIC. Nav is good. I like the split 3rd row, it makes it much more functional. The clamshell center armrest is actually really useful. It drives SO WELL.

Drove down to FL from NJ, and was so comfortable driving that I drove straight on the way back. The kids loved the Entertainment System that they did not even bother using the game system which we can plug in the truck too. Averaged around 20-21 MPG on our trip, and was very pleased with the good acceleration on the highways. Constantly getting looks hopefully due to its handsome styling. My only complain is that the voice recognition falters. I really enjoy driving this vehicle (which I think drives like a car).</TEXT>

I love the way the vehicle moves and the smooth braking action is awesome; not to mention the way it hugs the curb as I try to see what it can do... wow!!

<TEXT>I upgraded from an original 2001 MDX to this one and am very impressed by the quality and features they've added to the car. Makes my old one feel very bare bones. We did a 1,400 mile road trip over Thanksgiving with the new MDX and loved every moment. Powerful engine, feels wide and stable on the road, tracks well through corners, good sight lines. Very nice. The seats are very comfortable. The front seating areas are a little confining by design. Navi and entertainment systems are both very well done. Cargo space could be a little larger but larger space = larger body = more weight = fewer MPG. So it's not a bad balance as is. Overall I'm very pleased with this SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my MDX in June '07 after testing all comparable w/3rd row seats (X5, Q7, GX 470). For the value, it won hands down. For the same items and options in others would have cost an additional 10-20K. Have 10K miles of city/highway driving, and love every minute of driving it! It's more like a sport sedan than SUV. Ride and acceleration are excellent; seating comfort great in front & back seats. Yes, 3rd row is for kids and small adults, but if you want a full-time 3rd row, get a full-size SUV. They work great when heading out with a few extra friends. No question this is a great combination of value, fun, and luxury in SUV skin. Wife has TL-S - loves driving the X!</TEXT>

Brakes are stellar with the brake assist feature and with the stability assist control thrown in, your driving is completely technology assisted. We currently get about 18/23 city/hwy on premium gas. Interior is quite comfortable except for the third row which is best for kids under 4'. Navigation/sound system/backup camera/heated seats and dvd make it a nice long trip vehicle. The center console is a huge bin without any coin holders/small compartments. Road noise is prevalant at times. Tire noise is minimal. Lots of techno gizmos to keep you busy for a while.</TEXT>

The exterior styling is a real head turner, much better than the 2006 models. Visibility from the cockpit at night is great. Love the interior styling and dash appearance. Third row seating comes in handy on occasion. The navigation system is easy to use and convenient. Practically every feature comes standard. Back-up camera is a nice plus. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I tested the BMW X5 3.0 (too small, slow), the X5 4.8 (fast, too expensive!), the Lexus RX (nice, not sporty enough). This vehicle is a big step up from the '02 model: more power, better handling (doesn't feel a bit like a mini-van anymore), more creature comforts and roughly the same fuel economy. Driver's seat is very comfortable for my 5'-11" frame. The SH-AWD system is terrific as you feel it pull you around sharp turns as you accelerate. Nav. syst. has good display and gives clear and adjustable directions (from almost constant advice to concise directions). Hands Free Link hooks up to B/tooth c-phone on startup, sound system automatically switches to phone when called.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SH-AWD is great. The engine is very responsive if a bit rough at hi-rpm.

<TEXT>I came out of an Expedition to buy this SUV and was pleasantly surprised by how much more comfortable the vehicle is than a truck based SUV. The horsepower and performance are up from my previous truck/SUV vehicles, and so is the mileage. Those giving the MDX poor grades for mileage are not comparing it to other SUV choices. I regularly get 22-23 mpg at 70-75 mph on the highway. I chose this SUV for a couple specific reasons: I needed a vehicle that could tow my 23' boat and its trailer, but I wanted a comfortable, economical everyday ride, too. The BMW and Lexus didn't have the tow power, or enough room. The truck based SUV choices didn't have ride & economy.</TEXT>

Mountains, deserts, bad roads and good - we really put this car through its paces and have been very satisfied. The MDX drives like a car on twisty roads even without the sport suspension and the manumatic was very useful in the mountains. Interior space is excellent - we traveled with a baby & all associated gear. The nav system is accurate and easy to use. Highway gas mileage is better than rated (about 25 mpg), but city is worse (about 17).

I think we got it. Only a couple of downsides so far. The front seat makes my legs ache on long drives - in fairness I'm tall but not that tall.

There are so many minor details that Acura does right to make this car so much more than just a car. I do have some complaints, though, and they mostly relate to practicality: 3rd row legroom could be better based on experience in similar size cars; 2nd row seat buckles are poorly spaced for booster seats; 2nd row climate control vents do not adequately reach the 3rd row.</TEXT>

The style is great, so fun to drive and it is the perfect size for my family (3 kids). When I say fun to drive, I really mean I love to drive this car. To soccer games/practices, choir practices, school and preschool drop and pick up. It makes the necessary work and family driving less painful and that is exactly what I was looking for in this car.

<TEXT>Rear view is extremely limited. Very small side view mirrors and late to upload rear camera do not help. Back up lights are almost useless. The seats become very uncomfortable if you are slender. A seam cuts across your rear, otherwise they would be great. Our 2001 Lexus nav system was better that the one they pack in the MDX. The auto window lock-out locks the driver out as well as the passengers. Our dog continually lowers the windows with his paws, and turns on the heated seats both front and rear. The tail gate is slick, but the rear hatch opening is too small to fit furniture that, otherwise, should fit. The key fob is not intuitive. Take a long look before you buy.</TEXT>

Main problem that I didn't notice during my test drive: if you keep the seat erect, at a good angle for your posture, the head rest pushes your neck down !!! Most uncomfortable headrest in the industry. Acura claims that it is a safety feature, but it only works if you angle the seat back about 15 degrees!!! Mileage is okay for a heavy SUV. Get the sport package - handling is out-of-sight.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned a new 07 MDX for a month now, and have driven it close to 2000 miles in city and suburb. Comparing it to my past ownership of a Honda Accord and my spouse's BMW 5 series sedan, I think this is an excellent AWD SUV and I would, with no doubt, buy it again. The audio system quality and navi. are noticeably superior to the bmw's. Easy to drive around family and friends in comfort. Easy to haul luggage and purchases from the local hardware store. Rear view camera is indispensable (IMHO, this should be standard on all SUVs for safety). Minor quibbles: "live" traffic update is not so helpful, I prefer pushing buttons or twisting dials for commands rather than voice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 MDX a superb vehicle. It's truly hard to express how great this vehicle is. The navigation system is intuitive and simple to use. The voice recognition is excellent. The ride is extremely comfortable and the vehicle handles the road extremely well. I can't imagine how well the Sports Package performs. Overall, easily the best vehicle I've owned (compared to Explorer, Jeep, BMW). Highly recommended. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Huge side blind spots make lane changes a gamble. Uncomfortable seats. Dashboard angled steeply away from driver so in sunlight you cannot see the digital readouts. The 4 dash A/C vents almost close when you aim them to blow air at you. And under powered - if you think the 300hp stat means this car will outperform a 265hp V8, a test drive will show this car powers more like a 210 hp V6 costing $15K less. On the plus side, solid luxurious quiet ride and decent handling. Perfect for soccer moms. Not for inner city driving where you need power to zoom up hills and need to be aware of surrounding traffic in case of quick lane changes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this SUV early July, and am loving every bit of the vehicle. My family members including myself are owners of 5 Lexus vehicles (2 ES, 2 GS, 1 SC) and I introduced the '07 MDX to the bunch. I have no complaints so far and I love the luxury feel of the inside with an awesome sport feel that I would not be able to get from the RX. I test drove several SUVs (Audi Q7, RX 350, BMW X5, Buick Enclave, Chevy Tahoe, looked at the LR3, GMC Acadia) and nothing came close to the drive and luxury that MDX offered. Navigation and voice commands for nav, climate and radio are by far the best.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Undoubtedly this is the best of its class vehicle with outstanding bang for the buck. I am into 3rd week of ownership, so my experience with it is minimal, but all for now I can observe and suggest that Acura improve the ride with more comfort or sportier. Either be more like comfy Lexus or sportier like BMW. Regardless, my experience is still minimal and as it stands I own an outstanding car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a Honda Pilot and an Acura CL type S, I am a Honda fan. My confidence is being tested with tranny issues on the CL, but we absolutely loved our Pilot. The MDX is a step up at every level. The navigation system, initially appearing complex, is easy to use and very informative once you get the hang of it. The build quality is very good with a few minor issues (one being a ding in the quarter panel when we went to pick up the car). Power is just fine for a vehicle this size, and the interior is wonderful. If we experience the same reliability as we did on our 2003 Pilot, we will be very happy campers.</TEXT>

Seats are very comfortable and although some controls not in the most convenient of places, where else would you put them? There are a lot of features in this car. The navigation and voice recognition are excellent as is the handsfree phone operation. The most impressive feature is by far the DVD audio stereo system. The sound that comes out of this thing is beyond description, especially if you have a DVD audio disk. Overall, clearly one of the best SUVs out there today. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3,000 miles I am in love with my MDX Sport. The MDX handles like a sports car. The brakes are amazing. It stops on a dime. Gas mileage is better than expected (17c/21h). Best of all, the MDX moves! The MDX has more features than any other SUV in its class. The MDX won out in our comparison with the GL450, X5, GX470 and Q7. The MDX actually drives like a sports sedan and not an SUV. The same can't be said about the other SUVs we tested.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded my wife's 02 RX 300 that never had one problem for 5 yrs. We wanted something a little bigger. The new MDX has 800 miles and the windshield wiper fell apart and scratched the glass. Also am hearing a series of thud sounds when shifting 1st to 2nd with little to no load. Additional rattles are coming from the rear shock area. The dealer had the car for over a week and found both wipers defective and replaced the windshield. Also replaced the exhaust below the cat converter and replaced rear swing arm spring seat as it was damaged along with replacing the spring itself. We picked up the vehicle and heard the same noise.

We just passed the 5,000 mile mark and the MDX is still the best SUV on the market today IMHO. MPG=20.3, great reliability, comfortable and stylish interior. Plenty of room for kids. A lot of fun for road trips. I have heard people say that the car is too advanced, and I don't really understand that as a negative. The car is very intuitive. I am no computer geek but I have had no problems learning the tech features. If you pay this much for a vehicle, I want all these features!! Get a lot of positive comments about the car.

<TEXT>I have owned two other MDXs and loved them. This one is a major disappointment. The steering is tough. The steering wheel is impossible to find a place to grip it comfortably. The joystick navigation is annoying and distracting to use. No touch screen navigation. The rear/side blind spots are overwhelmingly dangerous. You simply can not see out the rear/sides. The front seat feels crowded and I have to crouch down in my seat to see the front of the car. The rear view mirror appears to block 1/3 of the vision of the front window. Overall, a very uncomfortable driving situation. Test drive it for a day before you buy it. A ride around the block won't reveal the problems. </TEXT>

It is very bumoy and the engine struggles. 300hp feels like 220hp. The center console will have you feeling you about to blast off into space. And the pencil thin steerling wheel feels like a 1980s Car. The third row cannot even fit teenagers at all. It does fell like an suv, it is more like a wagon.

<TEXT>Like BMW, Audi, WRX STI, only judge the MDX after it has a minimun of 8-10K miles. Improvements in power, suspension performance, quietness, door seals/wind-noise occur. Fast, smooth, 300 HP. Experience 17-22.5 MPG. Computerized SHAWD/Delphi-Magneto-Rheological Shocks and Michelins, corner like on rails with no tire noise/squeal. Suspension allows powering through steep/fast turns like no other car. ?Comfort Switch? allows MDX Sport a Lexus-Ride (leveling tar-strips!) or in ?Sport Mode?, MDX will exceed any other SUV's handling capability.

<TEXT>We have done 2k miles in our MDX now. Other than increased cornering ability and better brakes, this car is a step back from the previous MDX. The steering wheel is seriously uncomfortable and the centre console hurts my elbow if I am resting my arm on it while steering. The front footwells have poor room. The motor is rough for a luxury car and suffers from a serious flat spot between 4500 and 6000 rpm meaning performance is more theoretical than actual. For the NE the ride is real hard and the car bounces from bump to bump as opposed to flowing over the road so it cannot be trusted at speed. This car may be good on a track for a suv but is seriously flawed as a family vehicle for the road.</TEXT>

My allegiance has always been with my Bavarian brothers but this time I wanted to be different, and besides the Wifey got the new X-5. Surprisingly enough my sled holds its own with the X-5 and its horsepower advantage. Especially using my Sports package's features gets me through the Malibu hills quite spiritedly. Enough oomph to pass on the freeways of LA and enough panache to park at your trendy diners around town. It just blends in rather than the opulent massive bohemoths like Caddies and Rovers crowding our beloved city. Overall, the SUV is a fine vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is be our third Acura MDX and they have messed up a great vehicle. From what used to be smooth revving motor we now have the refinement of a mid 80's buick 3.8v6 and I am being generous. Yes the car can handle but at a price of crappy ride quality, the comfort level on the sport suspension is like driving a pogo stick and the sport setting is ok as long as the road is smooth. Interior fit and finish looks to be GM level, the exterior fit of various bits is not up to current detroit levels. The steeering wheel is asinine with lumpy bits here and there to grab and the bottom of the triangle means there is nowhere to hold when turning a corner. If I could return it I would.</TEXT>

Took a 600 mile road trip and several coastal drives so far. Do get the cooler to keep your beverages and food cold so you don't have to stop and buy food (helps offset the cost of the gasoline) .

<TEXT>Having owned two Toyota 4Runners, a Lexus RX 300 and a 330, and having test driven the 2007 Lexus GX 470 and the BMW X5, I can say without a doubt that the 2007 Acura MDX - my very first Acura - is the best SUV I've ever driven and much more fun than driving a car.The SH-AWD system alone is worth the price of ownership. The first big snow will make you smile because you'll feel safe and secure, knowing you'll get wherever you want to go. Actually, the SUV handles beautifully any time of year and Acura reliability means it won't be in the shop every month. The interior is classy and elegant.

<TEXT>Car drives very nice and is quiet compared to other Honda vehicles using the same platform. Features (tech and entertainment pkg) are well thought-out and appeal to those who can appreciate new technology. I only have 1k miles on the clock so it's still too early to tell how the MDX will hold up. Michelin tires are very quiet and handle well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear DVD keeps the kids incredibly quiet, rear backup camera is a nice feature. HID headlights are definitely brighter with a more defined pattern than halogen. ELS stereo really sounds nice too. Front and 2nd row seats are extremely comfortable.</FAVORITE>
