<TEXT>Decent car but not worth the $. Poor radio, poor ride quality and extremely loud interior. I'm 6'-2" and fit comfortable in car. Ergonomics are good but the position of the e brake is bad and uncomfortable on leg. Good thing is I got 33 mpg average. On long highway rides, almost 38 mpg. I got sick of the road noise and harsh ride and traded this car in. You can get more car for the money. I traded mine in for a Legacy. For $2K more, you get all wheel drive, awesome radio, awesome ride. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy and ergonomics of inside car. Loved the small steering wheel and heads up display. Very modern interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I like the car but it's not for everyone. This car is better suited for someone who works at an office, college student (with some cash or daddy) who will mostly use it on freeways. I average on long trips on the highway around 36mpg to 40mpg going at 65 to 70mph. I drive kind of aggressive so I get around 25mpg mixed driving. I work at a shipyard so I'm always dirty and carry stuff with me so having a 2door is impractical. Also I'm 6'1 and this car is kind of low and with the moonroof there is not much head room for tall drivers. Also legroom is a bit short. Other than that it drives very good, looks great and many aftermarket options. I have projector lamp and L.E.D tail lights. Test drive it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Digital sppedometer and dash. Interior looks of very good quality. 4-wheel disk brakes (better stopping). 2door, looks sporty and young. Seats are more supportive and better looking than the sedan. Steering wheel (better looking than the sedan) side door shape (again better looking than the sedan).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drive a round trip to work of 140 miles. We get 41 mpg with synthetic oil at 70 mph. Not 1 problem, car has 83,000 miles. Fun to drive, enjoy the great mileage and for the price is unbeatable. Tires will make it to 100,000 miles. Bought some comfy seat cushions. Downside is road noise but really not a problem. Makes you smile everyday with the mileage and we take 6-8 hour trips on vacation. We are in our 40's too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tight steering, great mileage, reliability above all, resale value, purchase price, fun to drive. Airbags all around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Over all, this a very good car. 32,000 miles on it and no major problems. Love the sporty handling and steering. The gas mileage is good. Bad sun visor design. The glue that holds them together seems to melt in the sun. Had to replace tires @ 20k but that seems to be the norm for most makes now. Driver's seat needs better thigh support.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great commuter car. However the only downfall is the light back end makes it slide in wet or slippy conditions. Runs as good now as the day I bought it. It does like to eat back tires so rotate them and service your car (i.e. oil and rotating tires) no big expenses yet. IT'S KINDA A TIGHT FIT FOR A 6FT 200LB guy but it makes up for it at the pump...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car because I was told Honda was a good brand and cars were durable and also the Honda civic 2007 has a very nice look. However, Just ONE WEEK after buying the car, the radio system started to mute itself very often, so I took it to the dealer and had to leave the car for two days there. THE RADIO SYSTEM WAS REPLACED. One year after, the car was hard to start in the morning and I took to the dealer at bayridge to change the oil and also to check this "little issue" and they had to replace the battery! Last week I took the car to the dealer again because it was shaking so bad when going up on a little hill and @ 1500 RPM. Guess what? The transmission had to be replaced!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like it. The car is fun and during the night it looks like more expensive car. I do regret getting it with the Navigation system, DON'T GET A CIVIC OR ANY OTHER HONDA WITH THE NAVI! It was waste of money. You pay almost $2,000dlls for something that can't play DVD'S and no bluetooth. It works perfect, no complaints there but with less money you could buy something with more features. Since its a coupe and it has a moonroof (headroom decreases) its only suited for young folks with no family and who don't carry a lot of stuff. If you do get this car, buy it some projector headlamps and L.E.D tail lamps, waoo! It looks great! I'm getting around 25mpg, but I drive hard. Best mpg its on the highway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Most of the interior, doesn't look cheap. Love the digital speedometer, especially during the night. Looks very sporty especially with black rims and projector lamps. V-Tec very good mpg if you cruise a lot on the freeway. 4 WHEEL DISC BRAKES.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had only a few problems with it. The electric motor at low speeds jerks the car until you stop accel or accel faster. I did not expect a sports car since this is a hybrid but driving it in the NYC (only got 25MPG in city) and highways (35-40MPG) a car like this is unable to get out of it's own way. This has caused me to get hit once since I could not get away from someone coming up behind me even when flooring it. I avg about 39-44MPG on my 30 mile one way to work and back. Car does not handle well even with new tires. AC does not seem to cool as much as I like, gets warm on auto stop. Road noise is horrible at 40+. Sound system is blah. Expected more overall for $26,000.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a Disappointment. I just bought the car and it already has more interior noise then any other car Ive ever had. The roof liner is loose the glove box is making noise. Recently drove to Vegas and the power on the car is embarrassing. Took a while to get up to speed to pass slower cars. This thing needs a lot more torque. Not to go fast just to get up to speed fast. Also the front end is so light anytime you take off the tires burn out. Way to much road noise as well. sometimes you cant even talk because the road noise is so over bearing. I do love the MPG. Over all I am disappointed in my purchase and will get rid of it at first opportunity.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Civic for two months now and LOVE it! I drive about 360 per week and average 36 mpg. This is a huge improvement from my 1999 Tahoe, lol. There is a blind spot in the rear of the car, and the XM ready is a joke. My husband researched how to install it himself and the pictures looked like Civic brain surgery. I must say the fuel mileage more than makes up for any complaints. Fuel in my area has risen to 3.59 a gallon. I love to look and see what the giant SUV next to me is paying for a tank of gas. I always laugh and think 'glad that isn't me anymore!' Also, I am a mother of two and my daughter fit very comfortably in the back seat. All and all this is a wonderful car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I originally posted a review in September just after I bought the car. I figured since I've been driving it for 7 months and 15,000 miles I'd post an update. I appreciate this car more each day! I've been averaging a shade under 51 mpg over the 15,000 miles. Interstate MPGs (75mph variety) drop the car to about 45 mpg so I stopped taking it. I live about 50 miles from my job and it takes me about an hour to get there. Very comfortable car with lots of head room and shoulder room. This car far exceeded my expectations.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Don't believe the epa ratings on the car. According to the epa mileage is 41/45 according to consumer reports mileage is 37 combined. After 6500 miles I am averaging 51 miles and as the weather has warmed my last two tank fulls were 57 and currently 62!! You will only receive these numbers if you learn to drive very conservatively but the good news is the instant mpg feedback indicator make this easy to do. This car rides as smooth and quiet and handles just as well as my 31,000 dollar Nissan Maxima. Interior room is adequate, I have 3 teenage boys and they never complain about the backseat.Finally if you don't mind a blue haired elderly lady passing you uphill as you try to save mileage GREAT</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun car to drive. Best pickup I've had on a "normal" vehicle of any kind. GREAT on gas mileage and reliability. Only problem I have with this car is the driver seat is very uncomfortable. I am of average height and weight but the seat is terrible. Great interior design and roomy for a fairly small car. Would buy again except for the seats. If they don't improve on them, I would buy something else.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I didn't do much research on this car before I purchased it, however I wish I had. I have had my radio serviced 3 times! It just shuts off, or doesn't start when I start my car. I would have to restart my engine at red lights to try and turn it on again. Another serious issue is BLIND SPOTS!!! In both the front, and the back. Horrible vision, must always readjust passenger seat after passengers get out so I can see. Car slide out a lot, and forget about trying to keep it on the road in the wind. Very disappointed, called Honda yesterday about a trade in!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my civic for 10 months, it has been very, very good to me. It has the typical 3rd gear issue, but if you go to the dealership with this (08-020) Service bulletin they will fix it free of charge. I average about 28 mpg in NYC which is great. In Ohio i was getting closer to 40 mpg on the highway. The MPG is better then my co-workers smart car, and it is much better looking as well. It has terrible blind spots, and the factory head lights are terrible. The stock radio is "ok" and replacing it is a nightmare. But for a stock car at the 20 grand mark. There is nothing more fun, or better to drive. It can use some more torque. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>High Mileage</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Purchased car for 30,000 miles/yr. Have put 32,500 miles on car in first 12 months. Great gas mileage makes it fun to drive. Slight "re-connection" jerk when going from electric to gas motor at traffic light in Autostop mode. Two tier dashboard prevents gauges from being hidden behind steering wheel. For me, seats are not very comfortable for 3 or more continuous hours behind wheel. I purchased separate back/lumber and seat supports which helped considerably. Highly recommend set of 4 snows for winter. Gas mileage dropped from 44 to 36 during cold months in the northeast. You'll get 44 mpg at 75 mph all day long. Only problem yet was a driver window that did not close correctly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for thirteen months and drive mostly on the Interstate. The car has been very reliable, has more than adequate power and is generally a fun car to drive. It maneuvers easy into tight parking spaces and the fuel mileage averages about 34 MPG regardless of how I drive. The only complaint I have about Honda and these Civics are the lousy tires that put on the car. The factory Bridgestone tires are poor quality tires and despite regular balancing and rotating, these tires didn't make it 20,000 miles. Also, the XM "Ready" status of the car is useless, you still have to buy an expensive kit if you want to have XM radio in your car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the Civic Si sedan for not even a year (13K miles on it). Shifting to third is notchy and it feels like there is something blocking the shifter from engaging third. The passenger airbag off indicator comes one when nothing is in the passenger seat. The indicator is supposed to be off when there is nothing in the seat but because there are no error codes registered when the light comes on the engineers at American Honda said there is nothing wrong with the car and refuse to authorize any repairs. On at least 5 occasions nothing happened when I turned the key to start the car. The starter spins but does not engage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When gas prices started moving higher and higher, I started thinking about upgrading to a hybrid. As a very satisfied Civic owner, I decided to try out a Civic Hybrid. It was love at first drive. The engine is extremely quiet, yet quickly responds and seamlessly transfers power between the gas engine and electric motor. I could not be more pleased with the gas mileage. On average, I get 48 miles to the gallon on my 22 mile highway commute. I would recommend the car to anyone who wants a more green ride, yet does not want to sacrifice comfort and style.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering wheel--much more adjustable than my '02 Civic. Also smaller in diameter which makes it easier to steer. Dashboard--I love the easier to read display and windshield which is raked at an extreme angle. It makes the interior feel much larger. Trunk size-huge-even with battery pack. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a car and happened to find the si. I have driven the older models and loved them, when I first got in the drivers seat of this car I felt like I was in a Jet ready to take off. I love the feel of the car. It sounds great, has great turning and can get up and go. You get a lot of looks in this car. This car is pretty fast if you need it to. The 8200 redline is a feature I really enjoy. When in 2nd gear and you hit the 6000 rpm the Vtec kicks in, and puts you into your seat. I cant help myself but smile every time. This Si is truly one awesome care and a GREAT purchase. I love the in car features as well. makes driving fun and comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I received a job that required me to drive 80 miles a day. My wife and I decided to trade in my 2006 Audi A3 (fast car) to purchase a car with better gas mileage due to the increase in travel distance. Initially, I test drove the Civic EX in A/T and felt it was slightly unresponsive. I later test drove the car in manual and what a difference! You are able to squeeze every ounce of power out of this 1.8 Liter engine. I loved the sound of the engine when I revved to the upper RPM ranges. I have to say, for an economy car with great gas mileage, this is pretty peppy and I'm a horsepower nut. The handling is quite good as well. The car's design lends itself to a low center of gravity.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been a Honda owner all of my life. I've had a 1983 Civic DX hatchback, 1986 Prelude Si and a 1993 Civic EX. The 2007 Civic Si sedan is the best so far! You get Acura features and quality in the Si and it's soooo affordable for a fun, functional, good looking, sporty sedan. The more we look at the sedan, the more I'm glad we waited for the 4-door versus the coupe. My wife & I love it and it's our family car now since we sold our SUV. The only recurring negative I have to mention is that third gear is a little tough to engage, especially when it's cold. Honda service has looked at it three times and claims there's nothing wrong with it. Other than that. We have the PERFECT sedan!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall packaging. This is a loaded car with everything a normal driver would want. The engine purrs and we get a lot of compliments from people about the exhaust note.

<TEXT>Honda is aware of an issue with the control arm, however, they are not giving a recall notice. I was told they are not making the owners aware of the problem, because it is "intermittent". I went in for an oil change and tire rotation at 14,000 miles, and was told that the inspection indicator on the dash was requesting that a full vehicle inspection be conducted. Since my gas mileage had gone from 41 mpg to 34 mpg, I agreed to pay the $150.00 to Sunnyside Honda in Parma OH for the inspection. I was told that the control arm was defective and that both rear tires also needed to be replaced as a result. The dealership would only replace the control arm and not the rear tires. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Civic Coupe hoping for a car with great fuel economy, reliability, and a good Honda design. The car handles very well, however, I am very disappointed with the quality of the interior cosmetic items. After 2 months the driver's side sun visor broke, then the passenger side visor broke soon after that. Just last month I noticed the driver's side interior pull handle plastic strip was loose. I brought it in to have the panel replaced, went home, and the whole plate came off. I would expect more from Honda. If you have this model, make sure you use your sun visors because I understand many others are having the same problem. The gas mileage for city driving is only 23 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is excellent in build quality and design. I drive 46 highway mi round trip and average 52 mpg with 64 mpg being my best under ideal conditions. If you relearn how to drive, anticipate stops (so you do not have to), coast downhill starting just before the Crest, etc. You can really improve on your Miles. It took me about a month of a feather touch on the throttle but if I can maintain 45-50 in moderate traffic I can achieve 60 mpg. If I drive More city routes or drive it like a normal car than my mileage drops to an average 40-45. Great car, comfortable drivers seat, excellent ergonomics, navi is a plus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 07 Civic as new in Jan. 08 with only 3900 miles. I have since racked up nearly 10,000 miles on the odometer in mostly highway driving. I have to say I am very pleased with the fuel efficiency of this car. I have averaged between 35 & 37 mpg on nearly every fill-up. This is a great car, much better than anything GM or Ford has to offer in the same segment. I considered a Prius until I stopped to look at who drives these things...OLD PEOPLE. The Civic has great exterior styling, nice interior quality, fit & finish and a reliability rating that is among the best in its class. Buy Certified Used and get an even better warranty. Paid $18,598 for an 07 EX/Navi with 3900 miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am so glad I bought this car. I have a one-way 53 mile commute everyday. Most of it is on the highway, and this car is doing great. I get 43-46 miles per gallon; more if I don't push it over 70. It is not the most comfortable car in the world over longer distances. Other than that, the cockpit feel is pretty cool. I love the jack to hook up my I-pod (I've listened to a whole bunch of books on tape), and the trunk space fits my golf clubs and that's good enough for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Civic SI has grown up, and so have I (....sort of). I recently purchased (3/08) a 2007 left over Civic SI sedan . I sold my 2005 Civic SI Hatchback. It was a great car. the 2007 has improved all of the features that I didn't like in the 2005 such as: less aggressive racing seats, adding a 6th gear, larger rims, and an armrest (front & rear). The 2007 is fast & can still can zig-zag through corners like a cars twice its price. The exhaust has a nice throaty sound. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been the family car for a while (including a back and forth trip NJ-FLA). So far the car is good, but not great. Maybe its the first year blues after the redesign, but already problems have arisen. The a/c went once already. The dealers story was that the condenser apparently got hit by a rock, and had to be replaced. There have also been windshield wiper problems which are difficult to explain but require fixing. Other nit picks include the exaggerated turning radius, the car easily bottoming out on speed bumps and such, crappy standard radio, and amplified road noise. Don't misunderstand me, this is a good car, I just wonder if there are better small sedans out there.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this in summer '07 as a new replacement for my creaky, marshmallowy '94 Camry. I chose the Civic SI in favor of the Mazda 3 Hatch due to the firmer, sportier suspension, better looking interior, and overall driving fun. I took 2-3 testdrives in the coupe and sedan before buying and on my last drive I told my husband "Get me out of this vehicle before I write them a check right now!" I will add that I've also experience the 3rd gear pop-out and grinding issues; thought it was just me. Have found that 2500 (right at abt 18-21mph) & 4000 rpm are where it likes to hit that gear best but you must be precise. I wonder if this is partially the "hang-throttle" issue.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the quick shifting gearbox, the suspension that is firm & sporty but not at all jarring on a daily basis. Overall appearance (Galaxy Grey) is subtle but sleek. The VTEC is waaaay too much fun to play with and bad for the gas mileage! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In 20,000 miles I haven't had any problems save for third gear being notchy. Will let dealer see before warranty expires. Small gas tank only allows about 320 miles to the gallon on premium fuel only. Si also requires synthetic oil. I wish the windshield wasn't so huge because the sun glare is bad. Overall, if gas wasn't so high I would buy again. I think I will trade down to a regular civic for better fuel economy. Can't complain about the reliability though, it's been awesome. Don't spend for the factory navi as Garmin makes better units for WAY less money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I put a lot of miles on any car and purchased soley on the gas mileage. Traded in my Element which now I wish I still had. After driving the Civic for 9 months now, I am not so thrilled. Gas mileage average 38-42 mph, but the car is not comfortable at all. The seats are hard and very limited adjustments to try and make them comfortable. No cup holders in back or arm rest in back. What was Honda thinking. Basically, I feel this is a way overpriced commuting machine. Not kid friendly, not long trip friendly. Honda also falls short in the "fun to drive" catagory. Corners horrribly, tire squeal. Listen, I don't drive like Mario Andretti. I was suprised at the poor handling. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Civic because I wanted reliability and good fuel economy. I have owned only small cars; this is the closest to a "big" car I have ever owned. It is far bigger than it looks, but drives like a smaller car. I am averaging 38 mph on the highway and 26 mph in hilly city driving. It also has the best heater/defroster that I have ever seen. My only complaints are a "lumpy" driver's seat and a parking brake that gets hit every time I enter the car. I love the digital dash; it is easy to read and looks "cool". I also wish that it had a trunk release button on the key fob and a sunglass holder. Other than that, it is a fantastic car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is decent, but doee not live up to expectations. I get around 35mpg city and 38-42mpg highway. My brother get 40mpg on average with the non- hybrid version. The hybridness on this case is not on par with Toyota's technology. I find several aspects of the car annoying. The transition from engine off to on causes the car to kick too much. The brakes will often slip when transitioning between friction brakes and electric brakes. On the reliability issue my windshield wipers recently refused to turn off (@ 17000 miles.) To summarize I would get the non- hybrid version. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The driving feel of the car is unbelievable. The seating comfort is very sufficient for all occupants. The heads up dash display is a little awkward and takes some time to get used to, but is very helpful. The exterior appearance is somewhat subtle but very appealing at the same time. I wish the front doors did not have the separate window panes, but it is understood as being different from the 2 door coupe. The gas mileage is acceptable, especially considering the 197 hp 4 cyl. engine. The vehicle is light weight and practically floats on the roads, but does not make you feel uneasy at all. Interior noise could be a little quieter, but the driveability is excellent so it does not matter much.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased for my commute to work, but found that this car is a good weekend car as well for every day tasks. Happy about the comfort, looks, reliability, and handling. Disappointed with the performance, the clutch, and lack of a 6th gear for cruising. My gas mileage has suffered because when driving above 65 mph on my commute, the small 1.8L, 4 cyl engine is working extra hard with the rpms at 3800-4000; which is why a 6th gear is needed. The clutch needs improvement and I know I can't expect much from 140 HP, and 128 ft-lbs of TQ, a few more ponies should be added. Interior dash is eye catching, and the mp3 capability is welcomed.

<TEXT>My test drive of the Si sedan left me smiling, road test reviews were great, and Honda typically has a good reputation, so my expectations for this Honda were very high. But reality set in after 6,000 miles. No torque! Real problems included: transmission jumping out of 3rd gear & grinding into 3rd gear, clutch pedal creak noises, suspension pop noises, and a creaky structure. Transmission made "gritty" chattering & whirling noises at low speeds. Warranty clutch & flywheel replacement did not help. Overall, all of these noises were fatiguing and the car was a disappointment. Traded it in for a solid 2008 GMC Sierra... something with substance, solidity, and guts.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I replaced my 1999 Civic coupe with this car in May as a little college graduation gift to myself. The more I drive it, the more I love it. Everything about this Civic improved over the one I drove before. The most notable things are the vastly more supportive seats, the odd speedometer that I have come to appreciate and the butter-smooth clutch, which only my boyfriend has managed to stall (and he drives a truck with a stick). It's got more than adequate highway cruising and passing power (though I would have liked to have been able to afford an Si) and a smooth, though somewhat noisy, ride. It handles great in heavy rain. I have not had the pleasure of driving it in snow yet. </TEXT>

With front wheel drive, I expected better than what I got but at 10-15 mph the car would not run straight while other vehicles were passing me at twice my speed. I will not be taking this vehicle into snow country again. Road noise is a bit excessive and the transmission is suprisingly rough. Fuel economy is excellent. Handling on dry and even wet roads is exceptional, but it cannot hold its own on ice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has a little bit of everything - looks, style, sportiness, power, comfort, electronic goodies, reliability and fuel economy all for about $20k. Looks very sporty. Initial pickup is a bit sluggish, but beyond about 3000-3500 rpm, it will surprise you with its power punch (torque). More than adequate power for most driving situations. Very nice and user-friendly nav system, more than decent audio system. I was quite a bit disappointed with the mileage (actual: ~26-27 mpg with 50/50 city/hwy) as opposed to the stated 29/35, but it could be because i like to step on the gas pedal a lot. Overall, still very good value. This car was made for teenagers/young adults. Go test drive it !</TEXT>

<TEXT>After the first 1,000 miles I remain pleased with our purchase. The key to contentment may be realizing that "performance" can encompass more than just 0-60 times, 1/4 mile, top speed, etc.. Performance can also encompass things like mpg, and in my world where commutes rarely allow anyone to enjoy the typical performance characteristics, I have realized that mpg is one of the few characteristics remaining for me to enjoy on a daily basis and I am glad to have found a practical car that allows me to routinely enjoy it while providing very good qualities in addition to being a hybrid. In spirited and often stop-and-go traffic in my 90 mile daily commute I have averaged 39 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having driven Honda's most of my life I had pretty high expectations for gas mileage. My 1989 accord would consistently get 32mpg in the city and I once got it up to 40mpg driving cross country. So I figured a Honda hybrid would get even better gas mileage. Talk about disappointing. If I really concentrate on my driving (gentle on the gas, avoid the brakes, etc) I can get the mpg's up to 34 in the city and low 40s on the highway. If my leadfoot wife drives it gets well under 30. After getting over the dissappointing fuel efficiency the car has been decent. It has a surprising amount of pickup and handles well enough to avoid dying in Los Angeles traffic. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car since I commute over 50 miles to work. I am not getting the gas mileage advertised, but it is pretty close (44-47 mile range), and I drive fairly fast (70-75 mph). I don't do much city driving but when I do, I get in the 40 mph range. It's still a great deal though and with the mileage I save, the savings are adding up. I am a tiny bit disappointed by the interior room especially in the driver's side. The head room is fine, but my right knee continually rubs against the interior dash by the radio. The seats also don't have the greatest support in the world, so one is pretty cramped after a long trip. Cockpit dash design is pretty cool expecially a night! Radio is great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace my previous European built Corolla sedan, which had given me 5 years trouble free comfortable ownership. The Honda Civic must be the most uncomfortable car I have ever bought, or driven. It's too low, has extremely hard unforgiving seats, the stupid handbrake which digs into my leg and makes any journey over half an hour very painfull (literally). The "A" pillar is too thick, and interferes with a clear view of pedestrians trying to cross the road in front of me at junctions. The front passenger footwell is too short, forcing the passenger has to push the seat right back to get comfortable, consequently there is no room for anybody to sit behind! </TEXT>

<TEXT>A great car for driving around town. Very underpowered on the highway and suffers from extreme road/wind noise at highway speed. The car is comfortable enough but long trips get very laborious because of the noise. The relatively low power on the highway requires drivers to plan passing and other maneuvers rather than simply jumping into another lane and passing a group of slower cars. If you are a "cruise-comtrol at 65mph" type, this may not be as much of a handicap as it is for drivers used to a car with much more power. I averaged about 44mpg at 75mph through hilly terrain. Bottom line: If you drive it like a hybrid and accept the tradeoffs, you will probably be happy.</TEXT>

It is fitted with conveniences previously found in only more expensive cars. The navi and XM radio are a delight, and the carefully calculated mileage of 36.5 mpg for its 11000 mile life is extraordinary. Fit and finish are excellent. Doors shut lightly and solidly.

I thought about a Prius, but the Civic is better- -and a better buy. It's standard features are better--and you don't rack up another 3K in price to get good features. I used Edmunds to get a read, and these reviews really helped me. For example, at 6'1', I needed more leg room--and got it with the Civic. And golf clubs fit right in the trunk. Two kids in the back very comfortably. I drove an Accord in high school, and this Civic is the same size--very cool. Pick up is great when needed; but it's mileage gauge teaches you to be a smarter with gas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is very fun to drive and very dependable. The gas mileage is great, yet it can get up and go if necessary. The overall body style is nice and sporty. Also, I owned a 98 civic LX and when I traded it in it still has a lot of life left. Honda's can easily reach 200,000 miles and keep on running! This car is very nice for the features as well as the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned this car for a very exciting 17 hours now! Looks awesome, very smooth and quiet ride (engine revs pretty low even on highways), very comfortable interior, very handy steering wheel audio controls (for audiophiles like me), great Premium sound system w/ sub, XM is great to have, haven't tried nav yet, haven't tried sunroof yet. Definitely could use more hp, but this is an economy car so that's ok. Great overall ride and comfort, very good value for your money. Perfect car for high school/college kids or an entry level working man like me! I definitely think this car has got it all. If you're car-shopping with about $18000 to $22000 to spend, you must check this car out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you drive with gas saving in mind, slowly & patiently this car is for you. Little bit of a stiff ride,but seats are comfy. CVT takes a little bit to get used to. Been accustomed to having a vehicle shift to each gear,now this cvt is shiftless just the one gear constantly adjusting for best fuel mileage. Power is what you should expect from a hybrid. I think my lawn mower has more get up and go. Steers like a charm and no complaints yet. I honestly drive like a grandpa. This car suits me very well. Performance is not this vehicle by any means. I've owned a Camaro with a LS1 engine, I know power and paying for it at the pump.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this little car. It is super easy to maneuver and so fun to drive. My only complaint is that it is a little underpowered for highway driving. There is plenty of power for city driving however. But that is the sacrifice you make when you buy the hybrid. But I do get 52mpg on the highway! City driving is more around 40 to 41mpg. Arlington in quite the hilly county so I am not surprised the actual mileage in city is not higher. I also love this car because at 6'3 the car is quite accomodating but I do have to have my seat all the way back. That means that the people sitting behind me are more than a tad cramped. Ergonomics are great and everything is within reach. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the Si sedan for five months now and I love it. I wanted a new car that was fun to drive yet practical because I am married and have two kids, 6 and 4. The Si sedan was the sportiest car I could afford and still use to take the kids on errands, games, etc. Thus far I have had no problems with the car. Although it is probably better suited for drives down windy country roads, it works fine driving around Chicago. On a few occasions I've been able to open it up down Lake Shore Drive and you can really feel wth VTEC kick in. Great handling in corners and curves. Safety features such as plenty of air bags great to have with kids in the car.</TEXT>

She was transported to Atlanta's Level 1 Trama Unit. 7 hours later, she walked out with me without a scratch on her. The extent of her injuries was when she lost conscious on impact and had a headache. She said the fire & rescue guy told her the airbags saved her life. I brought her the exact same car (different color) a month later. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car to make up for all of the emmissions I was spewing from my 1997 Saab. I thought the design and handling of the car were great. It did have a lot of road noise, but the gas mileage - 37- 42 mpg makes up for it. The only complaint I have is the fit and finish. I have been to the dealer 3 times already with interior replacement issues. So far I have had to replace one broken sun visor, a door panel(rattles), and a seat frame (rattles). Unfortunately, a new noise/rattle pops up every day, depending on the temperature and conditions. I was hoping for a better fit & finish for a $19,000 vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very happy with my Si Sedan. I used to drive a 2004 MINI Cooper S and then traded that for a 2005 Accord. I loved the MINI style and performance at entry level price but did not like driving 85 miles for free scheduled service to the closest MINI dealer. I won't buy anther MINI until I can take it to the BMW dealership in town. So needless to say the 4cyl Accord I bought did not make me a happy camper behind the wheel and I began to covet the Si Sedan. The Si is plenty fast for my situation, sure it could use more torque and horsepower but $22k is a bargain. I love the quality and dependability of Honda but they need to offer more HP in the Civic to keep me in them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was deliberating whether I should go "green" and get the Prius. I test drove the Prius. Nothing exciting, just thought it was cool that I could potentially save lots of gas. But it seemed to struggle a bit going uphill, so that made me doubt. Then I test drove this Civic 4 door LX AT. I was instantly in love. I had a 1997 4 door LX that broke down recently, just under 200,000. Anyway, the thing that caught me was that this thing has 140 horses! I could accelerate, even when going uphill, and I felt confident that I could pass anyone if necessary. But the 30/40 mpg, that was it for me. I saved about $3k versus the Prius, decent mpg, and I love the extra horses!</TEXT>

I thought the 'new wave' dash would be a distraction but turns out to be a really nice feature. Has nice pick up in the higher rpm range, however sometimes pick up in initial take off can seem sluggish. I'm getting about 32-35 mpg driving about 85% highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was driving an '00 Ford Escort and when I read the "noisy ride" Consumer Reports comments, I worried about the noise level. Alas, the Civic Hybrid is comparatively silent! I am getting 50+ MPG in town (flat Florida) with AC off, 47 with AC on. On the drive home from Ohio, I got 48. The transmission is so smooth I never notice the "shift". Wife (leadfoot) loves the speedometer placed right in the line of vision with big, well lit numerals. Braking is satisfactory (Accord is better). Acceleration surprisingly adequate but if you lead foot it, you pay in the MPG dept. The seats are OK. It's really fun to see how your driving habits affect your fuel economy (MPG display).</TEXT>

<TEXT>My SI sedan came with a leather interior. Yes, the car is noisy, it is designed to be that way. I got rid of a lot of the booming by lining the trunk, the doors and part of the floorboard with RAAMmat. The left front fender is designed to be an acoustic amplifier for the intake. This became apparent when the exhaust noise was dampened. My third gear was sticky. I replaced the oil with Royal Purple and it is perfect now. When I leave from a standing stop, sometimes, the steering wheel lurches to the right. Also, sometimes, I hear a popping noise from the left front wheel. All in all, a disappointing car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has exceeded my expectations. I have a lengthy commute (100 miles a day) and needed a car with good gas mileage. Gas mileage has been holding at 48 mpg for mixture of interstate, highway and city miles. At 55 MPH on the relatively flat Florida roads I can get about 55ish MPG. The Civic Hybrid exceeded my expectations in two main areas. First, it accelerates a little better than I expected. Maybe it just feels like it to me, who knows. The next area I was impressed with still amazes me. There is an incredible amount of room in the front seat! I'm 6'2" 230 lbs used to a full size pickup truck but this car has tons of head room, shoulder room and my seat isn't all the way back! Wow. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This Civic (07 Lx coupe, 5 speed trans) is fun to drive, peppy, has no problems handling the Ozark mountains, at or above the speed limits. Is stylish gets very good gas mileage, but the seats headrest sticks out to much and always seems to bump into the back of my head. Also the a/c vent for the driver is almost directly behind the steering wheel which blows cold air onto your hand. 2 very minor things. You get a great little car for a reasonable price</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is amazing. I have driven the car nearly 8000 miles, mostly highway, but about 20% city, and I am averaging about 53 MPG. Really, that is what the on board computer says and when I calculate it myself, I get more like 55 MPG. Either way, more than what the sticker claims. I drive conservative, but on straight-aways and downhill I go at least 70 MPH, and uphill around 55-60, so I do not drive exceedingly slow.

<TEXT>So far not too bad. This was a mpg purhcase, not my first choice for a new car. I'm getting 30 mpg, not what I had hoped for (34 mpg at least) for 80% highway, but better then the alternatives which is what made me go Civic. Engine whiens at 3500 rpm but still moves. Door panels are 3 peices and rattle with loud bass. Interior parts seem cheap. So long term reliabilty and mpg were the strongest features for me an while I may wish for other cars as I see them on the highway, I think about how often I stop at the gas station and feel a little better.

This car handles great, is quite speedy, and very comfortable. he seats feel wonderful and soft. The telescopic steering wheel is a nice feature.

<TEXT>I needed a vehicle with great gas mileage, yet big enough to hold luggage, two keyboards, stands, an amp, a large box of equipment, a large dog crate and a bicycle. I can fit all of this and more into my little Civic Hybrid. While shopping I actually had salespeople attempt to load my music equipment into a Prius but it would not fit. This little Civic is a joy to drive, looks great, is quiet and comfy and has all of the safety features I have come to love and trust about Hondas. I get anywhere between 43 to 57 miles per gallon, and find this to be a zippy little machine. I previously drove a Chevy Malibu and loved it, but for the savings in gas the Civic wins the day. Sweet little car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beautiful car - I got the icy blue color - and of course the gas mileage! I also love that I can cram it full of stuff.

I was drawn to the Civic line due to the quality, reliability, and safety. I fell for the Si because it suits this accountant who has a fun side in addition to a toddler. The interior has really grown on me and I find everything very easy to use. The seats are outstanding, great for trips and sporting. Transmission is superb as is the steering communication. This engine requires a driver who pays attention though. Great overall room, functionality, and value. Beats Mazda 3, VW GTI, Cobalt SS.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Honda has kept with their roots and made the most impressive car in its class. there are a few cars that may go faster becasue of larger engines and/or turbos. this 2.0 dohc i-vtec engine screams all the way to 8000 rpms and will smoke the competion that hasnt cheated by adding v6 or forced induction motors. The torgue is low for a performace car, but nontheless the car is zippy and the speed sneaks up on you. The 6 speed has short gears and pulls in all of them. The interior is very unique and some may not like it, but I feel right at home. It's a performance car, not meant for the average driver. Obviously I just got this car, so I cant say how the reliablitly is, but it's a Honda..enough said.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a bit disappointed with my 07 SI Sedan. I've had several problems with it. Tons and tons of interior rattles that can never be fixed, buzzing in the speakers, and now my 2nd gear is grinding like crazy. 2nd and 3rd gear issues are VERY common on these cars, and I'm now having trouble engaging 2nd gear at high RPMs, which is where the SI lives. The car is fun to drive, although it doesn't deliver what it should for its price. At almost 5k cheaper, you get the cobalt SS/ion redline with more performance. For a mere 1-2 thousand more, you get the mazdaspeed3/GTI which has a LOT more spunk and refinement to it. I would suggest checking out the Mazdaspeed3/gti before buying the Honda, sadly.</TEXT>

The map light didn't work from day one and way more annoying was a constant rattling from the rear passenger curtain airbag, also from day one. Dealership had my car for 4 DAYS and although the rattling has lessened, it's still there and very annoying. Seems Civics are hit or miss.

<TEXT>I didn't expect much from an entry level 4-cylinder sedan, but this car is very fun to drive and very well designed inside and out. I'm 6-3, and headroom has been a problem in the past, but I have room to spare. My legs fit comfortably too, not resting against the door and center console like usual. The only thing I need to adjust to is that the car downshifts with light braking, which is causing me to stop too soon. I suppose this is partly because I am accustomed to V6 and partly because the car skews towards a younger, less experienced demographic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The above-dash speedometer, fuel gauge and temperature gauge is beautiful. For once, I don't have to move my hands to see the speed gauge, as I often do with the steering wheel all the way up. The radio, though simple in my model, is very intuitive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car lacks power. You have to really "drive it like you hate it" to keep up with traffic. Most of its power is reserved at 6000 to 8000 rpm. Who wants to thrash their car trying to keep up with a mini-van or a truck. This car is an economy car without getting good mileage or a cheap price. The six-speed tranny shifts good, but in this car with its lack of torque, you are shifting every few seconds. It is loud inside the car too. I find myself saying ?what? a lot while on the freeway. I have had the car less than a month and the seats are a magnet for lint and dirt. The paint seems to scratch very easily. The car rides like it has not shocks. </TEXT>

It's noticeably smoother and quieter than the Lancer Ralliart I sold. For what it's intended to be it handles and performs well. It's a good value in it's class. After looking at Sentras and Corollas the Civic just beat them in design, both inside and out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Civic Si is a well-rounded economy sedan with some great performance features...a 4-door S2000 it clearly is not, but you can easily see the design influences throughout the car. Ergonomics are fantastic for a car in this class...the steering is very good, shifter is better than 90% of all sporty cars out there, and handling is better than I expected. Seats take some getting used to...I almost yanked mine and installed Recaros during the first week of ownership...but got used to them after a 1600 mile drive. Overall, I am very pleased with the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the Civic since 12/06. In the first 22 months & 14K miles I've experienced the following problems. Trans has been replaced, replacement tranny repaired, P/S leak, cv boot & joint replaced, new battery, both sun visors blew apart. 3 recalls, low fuel warning light comes on with only .6 gallons remaining, book says it should be 1.9 gallons. Front brakes will need replacing before 20K miles. THE most annoying problem is with the A/C, it cuts out for 10 to 15 seconds when accelerating from a stop. I've been to all 3 dealers in Las Vegas, & they all told me that Honda designed the A/C to work that way, a power saving feature! UNACCEPTABLE!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently had a problem with car such that the a/c was blowing only hot air. A trip to dealer showed an undiscovered leak in the refrigerant from the system. They were unable to find the leak after 4 hours and have placed a dye in the refrigerant to try to find the 'pin hole' leak. I've never had this problem with a Japanese vehicle. Has anyone else experienced this problem? I now am supposed to drive the car for 3 months and return the vehicle for 'discovery' of the leak.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a sweet ride. This is my first car and I love it. Imagine running in 3rd at 4500rpm and then you decided you want to pass someone slam the peddle down and let it rev up to 7500rpm getting thrown back into the seat and hearing a high revving 4cyl sounding like a Ferrari V8. Slam into 4th and let the V-tech scheme. What an experience. Going into coroners without any worry about how slow you need to go. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Got a new ?07 LX manual for under 17k. Great vehicle. I get a "true" 37mpg just about all the time (~70% hwy) except for in the winter. While I wouldn?t call it powerful, it does show oomph if revved high enough (if you have the manual). Corners well enough for an economy car though back end tends to slide out early. Only 4 complaints. The ABS seems to kick in prematurely when doing moderate braking. I had to get both sun visors replaced at about 16k miles. They were both coming apart and would eventually not even go up. Shocks/suspension makes noises when car is very cold (after a few miles it goes away). And as most Civic owners already know, it?s not the quietest ride.</TEXT>

Your door handle (inside) breaking, your windshield wipers not working on intermittent position. (recall) Your engine block cracking. Your bolts backing out of the fan pully and fatal to the radiator if they do come loose. Interior sun visors (this is a good one) being replaced multi times, seems Honda can't make enough replacements. Your broken (or missing) transmission bolts, recall. The list goes on man!

<TEXT>This car rides better than the 2004 Camry we had previously, but road noise is worse. This car has outstanding brakes. The EX has 4 wheel disc ABS brakes and a very sensitive pedal. The automatic transmission hits into gear and also into Park with a clunk, but at higher speeds it is smooth and effective. I make extensive use of the rear view mirrors in order to back up, and it works. The mirrors are a perfect size. The climate and radio controls are the easiest I have even seen. I love the large speed display which is at eye level. The seats are a bit firm, so we use a foam cushion for long trips. Steering is quick and sporty in town, but too sensitive for my taste at highway speeds.</TEXT>

All this with Honda quality and race bred experience clearly projected into the car. I have fun every day and totally agree with some of the other reviews.

<TEXT>This is a nice car! Roomy, comfortable. Great ergonomics, except for the lack of automatic headlights. Sluggish pickup, but that's the price for great gas mileage. Once it gets going, it's fine in traffic. XM radio is a treat, but the audio quality could be better. With my "No more blood for oil" bumper sticker, I'm having fun driving in front of Hummers. And with the safety features, I don't have to be intimidated by them. Handling is good. It's a tight ride. I expect typical Honda dependability. Trunk is big enough for most uses. Bottom line: Gets me where I'm going in comfort and safety, for about half the gas as my last car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After a wonderful ride with a Mazda Protege -- which I thought beat the pants off the old Civic -- I came back to Honda after looking at the latest iteration. The combination of gas mileage and reliability and the design of the new Civic are hard to beat. Despite my great experience with the Protege, I picked this in a close call over a Mazda 3. You couldn't go wrong with either one -- they are clearly the class of this field for styling, fit and finish, economy and value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG, baby. Didn't care for the styling at first but it grew on me. Dash takes getting used to but once you do it all makes sense. Great forward view.

My daughter and husband were in the car and we walked away without a scratch. This car handles well, has lots of storage space and I get 33 mpg (combo of city and hwy). Not to mention, it looks better than the Corolla, Sentra, and Mazda 3. Honda's last forever and for the price, you can't find a better deal.

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Civic (85 DX, 91 Si). For around 20K, this car is an unbeatable value. The drivetrain is incredible- smooth shifts (with the exception of 5th-6th) and the engine spins like a turbine. Rev to the top of the tach and you get a crazy rush of acceleration; its more addictive than crack. Cornering is flat and direct, the handling and the build are very tight, the stereo and interior are great (I happen to like the digital speedo), the seats are incredibly comfy, and the fuel economy has been great (two fills thus far- 27.5mpg and 29mpg avg). Top that with Honda's reputation for reliability and this is a no-brainer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you want quality, reliability, fuel efficiency and low emissions, this is the car! I've had my 2007 EX for one week now and just filled the gas tank - 30mpg city/highway was 40/60. Very comfortable and quiet. A lot of interior room for the size. Could use another two inches in leg room in the back. I am very satisfied with the car and expect 35 mpg when brohen in a little. I also expect to get 10 + years out of the car. Honda quality is very apparent and this car blows away all the Ford and Saturn cars I've owned over the past 15 years.

<TEXT>I have driven my new EX for a month now, and I love it. It responds as though it can read my mind. Mine is in Galaxy Gray Metallic and I think it's beautiful. Honda has done a great job with exterior styling. It's very attractive. Not only does the windshield give it a sleek look, but the windshield's angle provides great protection against breakage. While driving on the interstate, a rock from a truck in front of me hit the windshield with such force it would have broken the glass of my previous cars, but not this Civic. Honda has used every space for available storage, and has filled the car with every convenience, from the security system to the laser cut keys. I just love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first review still stands: all-around amazing car. Now I just have a couple nitpicks: The visors are rather poorly designed.

I have a hairline crack on the inner driver-side door release, which prevents it from returning flush with the housing much of the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new car. The gas mileage is supposed to be excellent: 30 in the city and 40 on the highway. I've had the car a week and still have a half tank of gas. It must be true. Gas will NEVER go down; why buy a gas guzzler? The doors are made high, which makes me feel safer. Some cars have too much glass. I wouldn't feel safe in a side collision in such a car. I'd suggest silver; it shows less dirt. White is pretty on this type of car; black, too, but blk shows dirt easier. There is a light blue which is handsome. I have mudguards. Glad to have them. The dash is cavernous. Buy a duster. This car looks more like a fine European car; what with its back-seat head restraints. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been very nice so far. I like the performance, spacious interiors, the fact that it is not expensive to buy and operate, and the 6 airbags. However 3 weeks after I bought it brand new, the very same day that I was to put the license plates in place, I noticed a chip in the windshield, and I feel confused as it is big enough to not be noticed when it happened. I am in a debate between repair or replacement but I'm concerned that a poor quality replacement installation can lead to bigger problems.

<TEXT>I got this car when my 2001 Civic EX coupe was totaled- I loved that car. I hate the new one. Terrible visibility due to blind spots, both in back of car and front- can't merge, or see pedestrians trying to cross the street. I thought I would get used to it, but no- even large SUVs have been in my blind spot in the interstate. The interior of the car is cheap- tons of scratches and I'm very careful. The paint is awful- tons of dings and scratches, and I live in the city- the car looks worse after 6 months than my 2001 Civic did after 6 years. Floor mats are the cheapest things ever- why the foam backing? I miss my old car so much, I'm thinking of trading my '07 for an '01!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked my Civic up after having an engine blowout on my SVT Focus. I needed a commuter car, and went shopping. I was impressed visually overall with the car, and fell in love with the interior. Went for a test drive, and was pretty much sold. There are very few things I don't like about the car, the biggest one shouldn't even be an issue because it's the reason the Si exists ( which is what I wanted, but couldn't afford at the time ). My other complaint is the legroom is just a bit short for me, another inch or two and it'd be perfect. ( I'm 6'3" ). Headroom is in short supply as well because of the sunroof. However, overall, I'm very very pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I invested in a Civic hybrid over an EX because the IRS tax credit, dealer discount, and annual gas savings make this almost the same price after the first year! The new Civic design is fantastic. Older generation Civics always drove rougher than Accords, but this generation handles very smooth and tight for a small car. I'm getting 44 mpg on the second tank and am learning how to drive the car for maximum mileage. I don't expect to get EPA mileage values of 49/51, but I will try. As for features the car has everything I need: navi with XM radio, steering wheel controls and voice activation, info display on dash for mpg, outside temp, trips, oil life, and total miles. Great overall car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wanted an affordable commuter with room for the family or friends, decided to add a bit of "performance and fun", and so far have had a blast. Sports suspension not overly harsh, but really have to hang on to the wheel while turning down-shifting, as expected. 6th gear really drops RPMs down, at 90mph was only hitting 4,000rpms, great for mileage and engine wear. As reported, not great lower end torque, and while noticeable, not even close to being a performance issue. Red panel glow more for younger demos, but it's OK. Really need the radio/CD controls to be lighted at night, hard to see and use. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my car at the end of March and waiting to until now to review it. I'm very happy with it. I did have a '92 Civic before and couldn't get rid of it soon enough. This car is not what you expect from an economy car. I drove from Philadelphia to Wilmington, NC for a wedding and then back up the coastline for a vacation. On the highway, I averaged 42 mpg with the air conditioning on. I didn't have any concerning the seats. The Civic has nice pickup and this is the only time I really hear the engine when the revs go over 2500. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was on a waiting list for this little coupe, and it finally arrived 4 months later. I am quite pleased with the handling. No other front wheel drive car, in my opinion, handles this well from the factory. Many aftermarket parts are available (as of this writing, July 07). There are a few problems I have encountered: clunking noise from pass. side strut assembly, drive-by-wire throttle issues, paint quality (POOR), intermittent wiper system sometimes doesn't work properly, interior scratches very easily. All in all, I highly recommend this car. Compared to the 'Cobalier' this is one car you would surely love to drive, and drive all the way to its 8300 rpm redline!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had the Civic for a week but I love it. I had been looking for a couple months and finally picked Civic. It's much quicker than I expected. This car drives great! The coupe may be a little tricky to get into for larger adults and the rear seat is out of the question for most adults. But almost everything else is great! The two tier dash board has grown on me, although I didn't care for it at first (too space ship). The car looks great. I have had loads of compliments. One lady said she thought it was an Acura. I've driven many different cars but the main reason for going with the Civic is the reliability. I expect this car to run great for many years to come.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased on 6/30/2007. Was looking for a reliable, fuel efficient vehicle since my husband and I carpool together most days and drive about 80 miles a day. Priced all others in class, and the Civic seemed to be the best bang for the buck. We both have fun driving it, and I enjoy the body style. The back end looks similar to that of a BMW or Volvo especially in black or silver. We live in AZ, and it doesn?t seem as if the A/C blows as cold as other vehicles that we have owned (maybe it is just because it is 115 degrees!). Other than that, I think we will have fun enjoying the car for years to come.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my new Civic EX two weeks ago primarily because of all the great reviews it received. I am very happy with the color (Atomic Blue), for which I've had many compliments, the interior and exterior styling, the many standard options and the fuel economy. I've filled up once and figured the mileage at 32 mpg with mostly city driving. But I am not at all happy with the ride quality, which is rough and noisy. Every little bump and dip is felt, and on rough asphalt it almost seems to vibrate. The ride is only smooth when the road is totally smooth. Also, the seats are too firm for my liking. I love everything about my new Civic except those two things. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When considering a new car, I needed a practical commuter/family vehicle but wanted a sports car. I can't imagine a better solution then the Si Sedan. The car is very practical with 4 doors, big trunk and good gas milage (assume Honda reliability will apply to my Si). At the same time, the car is just so much fun to drive. The high reving 2.0 L four is so smooth and the transmition is spec'd just right. I can stay in the powerband from 1st on into 5th (that's where my risk tolerance for speeding tickets runs out) The sound of the i- VTEC is totally awsome. The 17" wheels hint at what's inside. The fit and finish are high quality and the controls all fall naturally within sight/reach. Grea</TEXT>

<TEXT>6500 miles, no problems at all. Handling is equivalent to a Viper in the slalom. Summer tires combined with L.S. differential had no problem in 4" of wet snow at max 35mph! First oil change at 3000 miles switched to full synthetic. Recent 200 mile trip at 55- 65mph, conservative driving, yielded an astonishing 41mpg with 2 on board! Only issues I wish to resolve are low speed hesitation when engine is cold (exacerbated in winter), and balky 3rd gear engagement particularly when cold. Have come to like the funky dash layout. Incredibly comfortable, supportive seats. Great sound from intake, exhaust, and sound system. Happier with the Si than any other I have ever owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My last car was a Hyundai Accent, so my Civic was quite a step up. I love my car. That said, there have been a few problems. The mileage was initially appalling. Used to getting 42mpg from a car only supposed to get 37, I thought the Civic would at least match it. After starting at 29, it was a slow climb to the lower thirties for 50/50 highway/city driving. I'm currently faring much better - sometimes 40 mpg highway. Mixed driving around 35-37, suburban/highway. Some trouble starting occasionally last winter. Dealer said it was normal for a Civic. The 100,000 mile Hyundai did better, so I found that a bit scary - or flat untrue. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I originally went to the dealership to buy an EX model with the navigation option but as soon as I saw the Si, I had to drive it. I got reeled in by the sound of the exhaust which is mellow but strong and not "boy racerish". The 6 speed is silky smooth. The car is not fast by any stretch of the imagination. I have had cars that made 350hp with plenty of torque and this isn?t one of them. I was never under the assumption that I was buying anything more than a Civic to use as my primary work vehicle. It is a nice, sporty looking, decent performing compact sedan but you don't notice the performance until you get above 6000 rpms. That is where the little 2.0L really shines. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty appearance, nice rims. Good handling and a smooth 6speed. The Fiji Blue Pearl paint is amazing to look at. Fuel economy is good. The sticker says 23cty 32hwy and that is about what I get. Nice sound system. Big trunk. Comfy seats. The fun starts at about 6000 rpms so on ramps are always a blast!</FAVORITE>

My wife took this car to work one day and she loved it. It must be great considering that she drives a Mercedes E320. Once gas prices go back down, I am planning to buy a Mercedes ML 320.

<TEXT>I've had my Civic for just over 1 week now, and I absolutely love it! I put on about 400 miles already and I just filled the tank for the first time yesterday. I didn't sit down to figure out the mpg but I am estimating it to be in the low 30's. That is really good considering I do more city driving than highway (about 60/40). I love the atomic blue color, I get compliments from everybody! I also love the ride, it is so smooth. I traded in a Ford Escort and this is my first new vehicle and Honda purchase. What an upgrade from a Ford. I expect this car to last pretty long. As long as I don't drive too aggressively and I get my car maintenanced on schedule, I'm sure it will last.</TEXT>

Steering is tight, with good manuveurability. Excellent driver and passenger leg and headroom for a compact. The split dash is easy to read. Of course, trunk capacity is limited, but the fold down rear seat option works for two people on a road trip. Would like to have the inside climate control of my Accord EX, but what can one expect for a compact price? So far, it's been a classy addition to our Honda family.

The exhaust note is pure music. The handling is first rate (compared to my 2007 Mazda MX-5), as are the brakes and gearbox. The interior looks great, seats are very comfortable and supportive. The black cloth does show lint very easily though. I'm averaging about 27 mpg, but it depends how you drive. You could baby it and get 30 or drive like a maniac and get 20. About my only gripe with the car is the rev-hang issue. Revs don't drop instantly about 3k, not a big deal. Overall I love the car, beautiful.</TEXT>

I test drove a lot of subcompact cars before deciding on the Civic. All the others gave me the feeling that I was giving up a quality vehicle for a lesser one. I didn't feel that with the Civic. I commute close to 2 hours round trip 6 days a week. My gas bill has been literally cut in half with this car. It's fun to drive, sporty, and solidly built. I like the 5-speed automatic transmission as it adds to the driving experience. The ride is comfortable, too. Overall, it's a great value!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Being a father of two kids, I was growing tired of driving the family SUV with automaitic tranny. I went back to my youth by purchasing the Si Sedan and boy am I having a great time! After the initial break-in period, I floored the gas in 2nd gear until the RPMs ran over 6K. The car then turns into a monster with unbelievable acceleration with a Ferrari-like exhaust note thanks to the i-vtec K20 engine! I get about 250-275 miles per tank and spend about $40 ($3.80 per gal of 91 octane) at the station. Not bad compared to spending over $75 with my SUV which gets about 300-325 miles on a full tank of 91 octane. You MUST get this car with Navi and XM.</TEXT>

The lay out of the control panel is user friendly. I test drove the Prius and compared it with the Civic hybrid; the Civic has more accessible lay out. The Prius felt like an office desk on wheels.

Dealer was great to deal with. Mileage appears to be in range of mid 30's, but car is still in break in. Like my wife's 2005 Honda Oydessy, expecting many a reliable carefree motoring mile from my new Civic. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Just about everything. Especially like the sound from the standard AM/FM? CD player. Handling is outstanding. Engine is smooth and silent until you get up in the rev range when you want to hear something.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace my SUV. After attaining 41 mpg at 70+ mph, I'm finding fewer reasons to use the SUV. I don't feel underpowered when merging into traffic. The ride is more nimble and sporty than the SUV. The cabin is quiet enough, given the aerodynamic styling. Although the seats could be more comfortable and the stereo more powerful, I remind myself that I bought a low-priced car for great mileage. I bought a Honda, not a Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a Civic EX with navigation system for my wife.The car is incredible. She loves it and dubbed it "Beauty". Build quality, design and looks are great. I score the car 10. I would have liked a leather option on the Civic though and had custom leather fitted. We have not yet had a lot of experience with the navigation system, but I have found it slow to react and inaccurate at times. My Garmin Streetpilot does a much better job. It takes some getting used to, but the integrated navi system/audio system that flips open at the touch of a button is great. The voice command feature adds a nice touch.The best car in its class, competitively priced with lots of features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my comfortable truck for fuel economy and was worried that I'd be compromising too much, but I have been pleasantly surprised. Nothing else in this car class comes close for the money. Saving on the car payment is just an added bonus. For $20k the Civic serves up great styling, impeccable fit and finish, good handling and a fun driving experience. The dash is easy to read without taking your eyes off the road. I routinely get 30 mpg. The powertrain is smooth for cruising and pleasing to push when you have to, or want to, and it's sporty enough that you'll want to. This is the car other manufacturers could learn from. This is simply a better car with fewer toys and more substance. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had the car for a week, driven about 400 miles. The onboard computer says I am getting about 53 mpg, and I still have a little under half a tank left, so it seems like it is right on the money. And everyone says that it gets better gas mileage as you put on more miles, so believe it, this car can easily get 50 mpg if you drive like you are supposed to and don't try keeping up with the gas guzzlers going 75 mph on the freeway. I average about 60 mph on freeway and do both city and highway driving, and 53 mpg is the average of both.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the interior/exterior looks. I expect good reliability - I drove a 98 Civic until now. I bought 17" wheels, unfortunately that means I will have to sell the 16" set myself. I wish this was a dealer/manufacturer option. The road noise is pronounced on some low quality pavements, but not bothersome in general. In fact I test drove an upscale sedan for comparison and that was just slightly less quiet. I get 32-36 mpg city/highway milage in warm/hot weather with 95% AC use. (Also the odometer undermeasures by 3-4%, this will change with tire wear.) </TEXT>

<TEXT>Once you've driven a hybrid, there really is no reason to drive a regular car again. The gas mileage is better, it's cleaner, and saves you money. Why anyone would turn down a hybrid is a mystery to me. I average 47 mpg combined city/hwy. Hybrids, like any car, force you to try to get the mileage by driving sensibly. Just by keeping freeway speeds under 70 rather than my usual 75-85 added 6 or 7 mpg to my average. You have to want it and be conscious of it to achieve the high mpg range.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ergonomics are great. I love the 2-tier dash and driving position. The cupholders are nice and deep and storage options abound.

I was convinced to buy the civic when we took my daughter's 2006 civic on an eight hour trip to oregon with a total of four adults. We had plenty of room for our baggage including snow boards on a roof rack on top. My fuel economy is running about 32 mpg with 50/50 city/hwy. The only problem to date is the transmission has been downshifting at some odd times not sure why, I need to take into the dealer. I researched toyota, mazada and scion - when you upgrade all the other cars to meet the standard features the honda won.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It handles great although it takes time to get used to. Looks nice inside and outside, but the plastic inside is very cheap and has a weird smell even after 6 months.The MPG varies: highway between 38-42 MPG based on speed and driving style, but in the city is just 24-25 MPG without air conditioner which is less than expected. Another con is the the road noise because of the tires and lack of insulating materials. A great feature is steering wheel mounted audio control and cruise control. I forgot the ceiling light on, so the next day my battery died; this car should have an alarm to let you know about the problem or to shut down itself as in my husband's 1999 Volkswagen Golf. So be aware.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The cost of gas prompted my conversion from a 2006 GMC Yukon XL to the 2007 Honda Civic EX. I did not need a sports car. The Honda Civic, with its economical engine, reputation for durability and longevity as well as low price prompted my purchase. For several thousands of dollars more I could have chosen a car with better suspension, ride comfort and sound. But I get terrific gas mileage, a sporty ride (i.e. I feel the bumps on the road) and a sound system that plays the music I want. I'd probably be more attractive to women with a small BMW, but my daughters think the car is great so I suspect I'm as attractive to women as I'll ever be. My wife likes the size of the car, too.</TEXT>

This car is a Hybrid when you need it (around town) but a sport car when you need to corner or pass with speed. The interior design is just plain fun It is also great to be doing something good for the environment and my pocketbook. Overall after the tax credit, this car is as good a buy as any other Honda.

<TEXT>What a great car. One of the best cars I have ever driven. For under $21,000 you cannot beat the standard features. I researched for months what car to get and nothing came close to this in value. Fun car to drive. Good mileage, only down side is premium gas. For the performance that you get it is worth every penny. Interior is also great. Seats are extremely comfortable. All competitors don't even come close to interior quality. Noticed when researching this car that some complained about the smoothness when shifting. Now that I have bought it I do notice a very slight grind when engine cold. However, I have been told by many people it is as easy as changing to better tranny fluid and prob gone</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have recently purchased my Civic not too long ago, and so far it has been great, but it can be better. It looks great inside and out. Though it would be better inside if they used better quality plastics and made it more solid. Performance-wise, it delivers! Very zippy around urban streets and easy to maneuver in parking lots. The Vtec engine provides ample power smoothly. However, I am not getting good mileage in a car that is rated to do a around the mid 30 mpg range. In normal driving (with little heater/AC, non aggressive driving) I am getting a little less than 20 mpg. No repairs was done or needed, and the only real gripe is a bunch of rattling noises coming from the interior. Great car!</TEXT>

It has better acceleration than a 6 cylinder Mazda that I owned, and great interior comfort.

<TEXT>I have only had my EX sedan about a month, and currently have about 1000 miles on it. Thus far, I am averaging about 29 mpg, having driven pretty close to 50/50 city and highway. The car performs very well, is not overly noisy (certainly not for an affordable compact car), and has not disappointed in any way. The 5 speed auto trans shifts very smoothly, and keeps nice low rpms, even when cruising at highway speeds (pulls about 2250 rpm at a steady 70 mph). I would rate the build quality as very high, fit and finish is neat clean with very tight tolerances, no squeaks, rattles or odd noises. Having the AUX stereo jack is wonderful (works perfectly with my iRiver player).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the overall value of this car - the performance and "fun" you get for the money has no compare on the market. However, I think Honda skimped a bit on interior material choices. I've sought and destroyed a few annoying rattles - still have some rattles I haven't been able to fix yet. You really have to get used to some quirks in the drivetrain caused by the Drive By Wire (DBW) tuning - delay in responsiveness when you push on the gas and the car holds onto the revs (rev-hang issue). This tuning is all done to meet the CAFE standards and earn the Low Emissions Vehicle tag - ALL GOOD, but detract from the overall potential of this very fun vehicle.</TEXT>

Interior is ergonomic and attractive as well. I'll never buy another 5spd (6 is the only way to go). I have loved driving it, but haven't been too lucky. Other than the third gear issue, it needs an alignment and has a nasty skip when cold. Also, i can't get xm radio to work (followed the directions in the manual and also got help from an xm rep).

<TEXT>Bad car. Don?t buy it. Uncomfortable seats, extra loud alarm chimes and a cheap rattling interior made me sell this car after 6,700 miles. No excuse. Honda costs a couple of thousand more than many of its competitors' cars. The plastic interior is poorly assembled and it's loud. The cabin electrical wires are housed in a noisy corrugated plastic hose that vibrates at highway speeds. The seats are soft and have no support for long drives.

<TEXT>Have only owned for 2000 miles or about 1.5 months. To date I would have to say the Civic Hybrid is great except for the lack of it obtaining its expected fuel mileage potential of 49 mpg in town. I have been averaging 28-32 MPG in town. I was told that mileage will increase after I pass 10,000 miles. I hope that to be true. Also, the braking is a little weak. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased a 2007 EX 2dr 5spd. All I can say is wow! I went from driving a big V-8 to this, and I am having a blast. This car is well mannered, and very fun to drive. When I test drove it, I was thoroghly surprised. I love the fact that I will be passing gas stations, instead of having to fill up every three days. I commute 24-28 miles a day and this thing has no problem getting up to speed with any of the other traffic around me. This car is very comfortable, and the stereo is great. Now my muscle car can rest in the garage during the week, while I drive this EX. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I get 41 MPG in the city very consistently. I have gotten as high as 43 MPG on the highway. I suppose you could get 50 MPG if you were going down hill all of the time and didn?t run the A/C. I live in Houston, TX, so that isn?t very practical. I?m happy with the 41 MPG. This car qualifies as an Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emissions vehicle in all 50 states. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gives the Civic Hybrid a greenhouse gas score of 10 (being the best). The car qualifies for a $1,350 tax credit. The Honda Civic Hybrid was declared the World Green Car for 2006 at the New York International Auto Show. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had this car one day but I just took it on a 300 mile trip related to my work and had a blast driving it! For a new car, the fuel economy was very good. On my first fill up (in the teeth of a strong headwind), my MPG was 32. By the second fill up, it had improved to 37 mpg. This is driving at 72 mph on the interstate. The car also handles well and this was especially evident when I had a near accident on my way home. I was able to swerve to avoid contact and the car handled superbly. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of storage space for a small car (huge glove compartment), the car's handling,and the instrumentation on the dashboard makes this a fun car to drive.

<TEXT>I have just bought this car and have less than 200 miles so far on it and already this car has impressed me in so many ways. The Civic has such a sporty feel and yet its a very practical, quiet and comfortable ride. The reliabilty for Honda has always been high in standards and this one is certainly a keeper. The drive and the style is unsurpassable it doesnt do any justice just reviweing the car, it has to be driven to beleive what I mean by exactly. As soon as I test drove this car I knew in my mind that there was no reason to look at any other cars. The features that have been included are really cool and the accesories that can be added on just makes this vehicle flawless. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Aero body kit, alloy rims, moonrood and enhanced stereo system. The features in the dash such as oil life, and the digital speedometer on the eye level is pretty cool features that are just few out of many. the engine seems so small and yet it delivers good enough power. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the Honda Civic EX without a test drive since I had already test drove the 2006 Civic and the 2006 Toyota Corolla last year. I liked the way the Civic drove while being somewhat of a cross between an economizer sedan and a luxury car. Highway mileage at 40 seems to be a misnomer. I can't beat 36 mpg with slow acceleration highway although I have less than 2,000 miles on the car. My previous new Civic (1990) beat the ratings, so these new ratings seem to be overly optimistic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've put about 2000 miles on my 2007 EX Civic Coupe. Averaging 28 mpg city and 35 mpg highway. I like the car for city driving, but it has annoyances that may force me to sell it in the long run. On long trips its bouncy suspension makes me car sick and the twitchy steering forces you to stay alert. Head clearance is a MAJOR problem for those taller than 5'11". I'm 5'11.5" and my head is 1/2 an inch from the roof. It's very irritating when my hair brushes the roof. It's driving me crazy. Should have gotten the DX with 1.5 inches extra clearance due to no moon roof.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up my hybrid last week so it is too soon to know quality/reliability. Hoping Honda's reputation for building reliable cars holds true. Car is fun to drive and so far I have been getting about 35 MPG in town (I almost never do highway driving). Car takes a little getting used to as the hybrid system can be a little jerky at slow, coasting speeds as the regenerative braking system charges the battery. Other than that the hybrid system is seamlessly integrated and the result is a nice ride with ample (not great, obviously) acceleration. The seats are a little uncomfortable and really lack lateral support.</TEXT>

<TEXT>While I've only had the car a few weeks, I'm very happy so far. I was looking for a "sporty" car that used regular gas and got good mileage. I was concerned about the power since I was used to a V6, but it's really peppy and responsive. The steering feels very direct and the brakes are strong. I test drove a lot of cars, some quite a bit more expensive, but I really liked the whole package this Honda gives you. While I DO NOT like the Sedans styling, I LOVE the Coupe. Mine's Red and it is sharp looking.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My review probably won't be as extensive as the others I've ready, however I do want to make one thing clear: this car is almost unbelievable. The amount of swag that Honda packed into this thing for such an affordable price is unprecedented. If you're looking for an everyday commuter that won't drive you crazy in rush-hour traffic, the Si trim may not be for you. This car wants to go fast and is very insistent about it. My only complaint is a "rattle" from the lower portion of the passenger seat. The service folk have at least been helpful in trying to get it fixed, though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 1999 Mazda Protégé? for this 2007 Honda Civic LX and it?s a vast improvement over my old Protégé which was a car that I really liked. The Civic has a much more sophisticated feel, handles extremely well, and has a sporty space ship-like interior. The gas mileage seems to be about the same as the Protégé, but it?s a slightly roomier car, so that not an issue. I?m glad they put the speedometer out so far on the dash, because I find myself going faster than I think I?m going and it?s easy to see my speed and slow down before I get pulled over. I do find that the long dash causes a reflection on the long windshield, it helps to use polarized sun glasses during the day.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a compact car with great mpg, enough room for 4 other passengers, lots of features, reliability, low-maintenance, and good resale value. Civic was the perfect fit. Just bought it a month ago. Many people complimented on nice atomic blue color. I'm somewhat disappointed by the mpg. I realized that the advertised 30/40 mpg is unrealistic, but I still expected it to be better than what I'm getting. I got only 21 mpg on the first tank, then average 28 mpg after that (combined city/highway). It doesn't seem to get any better, but I'll see. MP3/WMA player is nice. Audio control on the steering wheel is great. Must get used to not being able to see the front of the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Seats provide no lumbar support, very uncomfortable on drives over 30 minutes. A $200 cushion fixed this for me. Am radio can barely pull in stations, my 95 nissan truck had no problems with this. Road noise seems to be greater than most cars, but you seem to get conditioned to this. The pick up is good and the ride is smooth. Biggest complaint is car handles like crap at highway speeds. Body seems to roll, sway. If you follow another Civic it will look as if they are on ice when they change lanes. This is not due to the tires or their inflated psi. Have read on other forums that others are having the same problem and the heavier sway bars from the Si coup,Si sedan, will help greatly.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy. It's why I bought it. Have 3500 miles on car so far and each tanks mpg gets better no matter how I drive. First tank was 29 mpg and the last was 35 mpg with 80% hwy driving. Body style, replaced hubs with custom wheels and the car looks 100% sportier,</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I may be a little more subjective in my review - I used to drive an S2000 before I bought my Si. I liked the Si cause it had some of the same feel - the steering wheel, the shift knob, the digi gauges. I definitely miss the power - it's quick but it can be faster (i wish i could be at 60 mph in second). Fuel consumption is the same as my S2000! I thought I'd get better MPG but I don't (it does have a bigger tank). The paint chips easily and I already had to replace the windshield due to a rock hitting it. Handling is impressive - so much so that it is quite comparable to the S2000. I wish this had HIDs! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a new Civic Hybrid 07 - I have purchased three tanks of gas and calculated actual miles driven with gallons of gas and got 29 mpg, 29 mpg and 28 mpg; not impressive. The whole purpose of the purchase was to get excellent MPG- the dealer quoted 40 city and 60 highway - I do city driving and am nowhere close. Beaverton Honda says the engine has to break in at about 2000 miles I have 900 miles now on the car. I am very disappointed. I did not even question that the actual MPG would be soooo far off from the sticker advertisement. I am sure Honda Corporation would be interested in my comments. So much for going GREEN!--I got ripped off!!!</TEXT>

I drove a Honda Insight hybrid on same roads for the last five and a half years. Hwy was 69-70 mpg with max of 83. City was more like 39 mpg. The point is, I am a hybrid driver. Insight was stick. Civic automatic. Can't imagine I'm doing something so wrong to get less mpg than most small cars, much less what hybrid should get. Any thoughts from anyone? Brought it into dealer twice. They said they got 35 city/44 hwy in 10 mile test drive. I have driven 1000 miles now, with a continuous avg of 20-22 city. With heat on or off. looking for answers</TEXT>

<TEXT>After a lot of research on many cars of this size we decided to spend the extra money to buy the civic mainly for the gas mileage. We were way wrong in this purchase, the car gets only 19 to 23 miles per gallon, 85 percent highway miles, 15 percent stop and go traffic, the dealer says thats normal and will get better when the car gets 20,000 miles or more on it. That will take us almost 2 yrs to get decent mileage! If we knew we were going to be getting this poor of mileage we would have bought an SUV. The automatic transmission makes weird sounds, when you are slowing down then speed up the car almost dies, the dealer says nothing wrong with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought our 2007 LX automatic sedan in January, and have been happy with it. The car has been getting on average 27 mpg, and that is mostly rural hilly driving, with some city mixed in. I expect (and hope) it will get better with time, and once we are done with winter. I like the speedometer/fuel/temp gauge location much more than I thought I would. The engine and transmission work well together, but I wish it had a manual setting, or one more selection, such as D4. Car is well built, handles well, and has a nice feature content for the price. I do wish it had about 1 more inch of seat travel, as I am 6' 1" and also bump my knee on the brake lever like some have mentioned. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new civic. I had a 1997 civic, so the redesign was a fantastic improvement. It truly feels like a luxury vehicle, at half the price. The gas mileage is terrific, too. Be warned about buying one, the three dealerships I went to in the Orlando area printed out the Edmunds TMV info from this webpage, and would NOT go below that price. It's too popular to haggle, apparently. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Last year my family decided to take a step forward and bought a 2006 Toyota Prius. I was very happy with its performance and averaging around 45-48 mpg. This year I also needed a commuter car. I was about to get another Prius, but I decided to give the Civic Hyrbid a try. In my opinion, I really liked the styling of the Civic better than the Prius that my wife drives. I have put a little over 2,000 miles on it already and have gotten 51 mpg, better than the Prius. But of course the Civic is a bit weaker than the Prius. The dash layout has a airy spaceship cockpit layout. Although the interior is not as big as a Prius, the fit and finish is top notch. It has good driving position.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 Civic EX manual in December 2006. The car is a pleasure to drive: impressive acceleration for a 4-cyl naturally aspirated engine, tight handling and quick response. The car gives you confidence when you drive. The exterior design is modern and attractive, and the interior is surprisingly roomy and has a solid feel to it. The seats are comfortable and it can seat 4 comfortably, 5 in a pinch. The mileage has improved with each fill up. In the city I got 25, then 27, and now 28; on the one long trip I took I averaged 36 mpg. My only complaints are the thin paint that chips off easily and the engine whine sound. Overall, I am very happy with my new Civic and recommend it!</TEXT>

Only concern I have is that lately the radio/CD panel tends to get hot to the touch, including the buttons to switch stations. When I pull out the CD, the CD is also hot. Not sure where heat transfer is coming from. Also have a rattle on right door panel that I can't seem to locate; sounds like a piece of plastic vibrating.

<TEXT>I have about 5k on my new civic and now have had a little time to get to know the car. It drives great, but lacks just a little bit of power to say it performs great. Fuel mileage is terrific. I drive 120 miles roundtrip to work each day; all freeway driving. The car is averaging about 34-36 mpg using the cruise and staying around the 70 posted limit. NAVI system is great and voice command is fun to play with. Tight build, absolutely no rattles or squeaks. Engine noise during accleration is louder than I expected. My 2003 Accord LX I-4 Automatic was much smoother and quiet. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very good handling with ample power. My grade-school boys refer to it as their "Hot Wheels" and love riding in it... quite zippy and fun to drive. The sensitive drive-by-wire accelerator takes getting used to (jerky, hard to launch gradually and smoothly); the automatic transmission feels intrusive or hesitant at times. My only major gripe is the road/tire and engine noise; Honda should add some more sound insulation and it would be the PERFECT choice in this category. Otherwise, it's an excellent value and I'm very pleased with it overall! </TEXT>

<TEXT>My old 1992 NX2000 was costing too much to repair so I needed a replacement. I wanted a vehicle that had a limited-slip differential and side-airbags for no more than $22,000 base price. The Mazdaspeed3 was just above my price range, and the Subaru WRX was too ugly and overpriced. Honda was selling to people like me when they decided to release a 4-door Civic Si to the market. The car has so much power you will need set of winter tires for safe winter driving. The ride can be a little stiff, but what did I expect from a sports sedan. Honda build quality, Honda reliability, Honda motor, Honda resale value, and price of admission made this the clear choice. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine loves to go! I noticed the VTEC kicks in at about 3000 rpm when accelerating. All the safety features anyone could want including Vehicle Stability Assist (which can be turned off!).

<TEXT>when I first saw the car , I was impressed by the beautiful exterior design. I got mine with the front under spoiler and fog lights and it looks very aggressive. I also got the interior panel trim which makes a big difference over stock. The car is lots of fun to drive. My only complaint is that it needs more power. In order to get those 197 horses you need to push the engine over 7000 rpm, which I think it's not healthy for the engine. In conclusion it's a great buy just needs more power. Turbo or supercharger will be nice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The fuel mileage stinks! Just drove 257 miles in 3 weeks, all on city streets, mpg was 21.59! With the A/C in the summer I'll be lucky to get 20 mpg!! Keep in mind that my '00 Maxima would get 17.5 in the same situation! That's 257/11.9=21.59 for the Civic! Highway mileage does better. To San Diego was 34.9 mpg, returning was 31.0 mpg. When gassing up be sure and top- off. The tank will take another 2 gallons after the automatic shut-off! Another problem is AM radio reception. With my other cars I was able to pick- up stations in downtown L.A. beginning in Victorville, Ca., not possible with the Civic. Honda Civic, 30 mpg in the city, what a joke! I would be happy with an honest 25 mpg city.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I chose the Civic Hybrid for its smooth, quiet operation, driveability, advanced standard safety features, exceptional ergonomics, amazing instrument panel...and those 50 miles per gallon. I liked it when I got it, and I love it a few months later. It moves and handles well, protects my family like a vigilant Doberman, and lives up to its advertised MPG. My highest observed sustained mileage was 58.3 on a highway trip; I average around 47 mpg in largely-urban commuting and around town. Steering is quick and precise, braking is sure and solid. Other favorites: Standard 4-channel ABS with brake distribution and brake assist, Honda's exceptional airbag system and the tilt/telescope wheel.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth, quiet, economical operation; excellent finish, great functionality; NAVI system easy to use and endlessly helpful. Great handling dynamics. Much simpler and more elegant to operate than Prius, its major rival. Exceptional safety and driveability in a state-of-the art 50 mpg sedan! </FAVORITE>

We recently had a snow storm here in Iowa and it actually got around pretty well. Obviously I am not expecting 4 wheel drive performance in the snow, but it did just as well if not better than other front wheel drive 4 cylinders. I can't stop playing with the navigation/radio screen, which is probably not safe, but it is just too tempting to have that touch screen in front of you</TEXT>

<TEXT>My daily driver accumulated a quarter million miles (a 95 Jeep Cherokee Sport) and I needed another vehicle for 3-4 years to commute with great mileage. Though I only have now driven the Civic 1800 miles, the things that are most impressive are: 40 mpg @ 65 mph hwy mileage is not only the EPA estimate but right on the money. Handling is better than expected. Comfort was good on my recent 8 hour freeway drive. Standard radio/speaker was adequate. I haven't tried the standard CD player. Quite frankly, I wanted a vehicle to get great mileage and emulate an S40 Volvo w/sunroof. I drove an S40 and loved it. The Civic EX is better in many ways. So far, this is a great low end vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a great looking car & a lot of fun to drive. The car handles exceptionally well with the tradeoff being a ride that is rather stiff. There is a definite loss in gas mileage with the SI and being a usually thrifty person I would have to give hard consideration to the EX if purchasing again. Was pleasantly surprised at how well the cruise works with the manual transmission, much smoother through hills than the cruise was in my 4 cylinder Ford. The interior is arranged so that radio, temperature controls, etc are easy to find & use. Whether or not it is the best value for the money can be debated but when you are behind the wheel there are no regrets. This is one very nice vehicle!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Music is a large part of my life, the mp3/wma playback with 7 speakers including a sub is a great sounding standard equipment radio.

<TEXT>I bought the car 2 days ago,I own a rsx- s as well, which is also a great car, but i needed a car with good fuel economy since i drive 140 mi. round trip to work most days. I like leather but the cloth seats are so comfortable i could fall asleep. the clutch works great and it shifts smooth as well. I am used to a short throw transmission, but the EX is fine. The drive by wire throttle system takes some getting used to, i am not used to the rpms "hanging" while i shift, but you get used to it. so far I'm at 220 mi, and i still have half a tank! I'm 6'3 and its hard for me to see the speedo because my hand is in the way, so i adjusted the steering wheel lower. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have just taken delivery of my 2007 EX with Navi/XM radio. My trade was a 2006 LX with 38,400 miles. The EX is the same as the EX except for the Navigation system, XM radio, sunroof, auto lock with put in drive, ability to electronically open the truck, center arm rest in the back seat, etc. This is a great improvement in terms of amenities, the car itself is absolutely outstanding. I have had highway mileage as high as 46 and routinely get 41 and 42 miles per gallon. This has been documented with my dealer. I have used synthetic oil and have run with premium gas. The premium gas gives me 5-6 miles gallon. I am looking forward to breaking in my new EX.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation system is very easy to use and set up. The same comment can be made for setting up the radio. The sunroof helps to brighten up the interior, although with my LX it was not an issue. The gas mileage is absolutely terrific. I get over 40 mpg on the highway which is outstanding.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked up the car on a Thursday, drove it halfway across the country 2 days later. This is my second Civic to own; my last one lasted 12 years and was doing great (just got to 160,000 miles and I wanted to update my car). Anyway, the 10 hour trip was actually fun. I would definitely invest in the NAV system again. My mileage is not quite what they promised, but whose is? I got 42 mpg on the highway, about the same in the city. I was getting in the upper 20s with my last Civic. Anyway, great car. The most comparable car would be the Prius, of course. I just didn't like the idea of depending on a camera to back up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>NAV feature is great and has voice command. It also has automatic climate control. The dashboard reminds me of the display on an aircraft. The real-time mpg display is fun to watch. Great sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my my civic hybrid after reading all the reviews. The gas mileage is lower than the sticker mpg, about 43 mpg, but still a lot better than my last car. It is definitely not for people who like speed. It'll get there, just in it's own time... I test drove a 2006 with the spongy breaks and crazy abs. Honda must have read the reviews too, because they've fixed the breaks for 2007. A great little car, excellent visibility (which seems to be a problem in most new cars!). I'm 5'2" and am comfortable, my husband is 6'2" and comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased it to get CA carpool sticker before they disappear. I have been very pleased so far. With 4 tanks of gas, I seem to get around 45MPG overall. The dash calculated values are a bit lower than when I do the miles divided by gallons purchased calculation. If you keep under 70 mph, you seem to get closer to 50 mpg. If you go closer to 85 mpg, it goes down into the low 40's. Stop and start commute traffic gets you in the highto mid 40's. Nothing I do results in the mileage leaving the low 40's. The radio sounds great with my Ipod. I'm not thrilled by the tranny but it seems to get the job done in terms of mpg. Acceleration seems fine as long as you don't stomp on it. Overall, I'm pleased!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Happy with Dash, radio, and interior. I have a Garmin Ique that sits perfectly along side of the speedometer (like it's made for it!) Configurable auto door locks are cool. Visibility is nice. I enjoy feeling "smarter" than the other commuters when my engine is off!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In its price range, the Si stands out. Stock, it's on par with the GTI, Cobalt, supercharged tC, and RSX Type-S. Yet the GTI and supercharged tC are limited as tuner cars and are more expensive for the setup and don't handle as well. The Si even compensates for low toque with its high rev short throw setup. It's interiors and Honda's build quality beat out the Cobalt and RSX (how it beats the "higher class" version of the same company is a mystery to me), and the GTI's exterior is a matter of personal taste. Whether its stock or tuned, the Si packs a punch behind the wheel and outdoes its competitors. It even has bonuses like a 300w audio system, moon roof, and a sleek racy design.</TEXT>

<TEXT> The car feels well built.This model is built in japan, better quality control and fit and finish i feel. driving is very different, than my 2001 civic i traded in. U do have to learn to drive with a gentle foot on the gas. its almost a glide and coast approach, looking ahead at lights and traffic to let off gas as much as possible.This seams to give best fuel economy. With engine shutoff at every stop, car does take 2seconds to respond and go. Seats are supportive but seam too narrow for me and center console takes up leg room for stretching. Gauges are nice and easy to read but if your short u will see them reflect on upper windshield glass. Too much road noise, quiet tires might help.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a fantastic car! Other cars I was considering were the, SI coupe, Eclipse, GTI, and Cobalt SS. Dollar for dollar nothing else in the market offers the same good looks, features and performance as this car. I drove all of them and came back to this one. Personally I think the sedan looks even better than the SI coupe. I have a 7 month old daughter and have car seats in my future for the next 8 years so that made the choice even easier. Simply one of the best values that can be had for around $21K. Owned the car for only two days so long term I cannot comment, but so far, its been great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fantastic transmission, short throws and very smooth. Still getting used to the 6 speed though. I love the gauge layout and dash design in general, makes others look cheap even when there not. Very precise steering and handling, car feels "tight". Love the looks.

<TEXT>I agree the headrests are painfully forward (but I guess that's to help in a crash. May try the Accord headrest swap, thanks!) Road noise on certain surfaces, otherwise nicely quiet. Getting 28 mpg on my 60/40% city/hwy commute. Good handling (0.81g!) on Eagle RS-A tires. I like the surprisingly quick steering ratio for an econo-sedan. The digital gauges do work well - you can keep your eyes on the road ahead while checking speed/temp/gas. Accelerates quickly enough, esp. considering the fuel economy. Headlights work well with wide even light pattern and flat European cutoff. </TEXT>

<TEXT>this car is great! it is the best civic yet and #3 for me. I was looking for a 4 door safe car for my family and me yet I wanted something fun to drive . I started looking at a number of cars A4, mazdaspeed6, legacy GT,and camry SE v6, the a4 was overpriced with little power. mazda6 was pretty much a ford and resale was bad but was fun to drive.I wanted the legacy GT it was fun to drive the fastest family car under 30k but the back seats are tight and the shifter is clunky with a terrible jerk into 2nd gear. (with a manual) handling was not all that good either and the resale is not all that good. than I found the civic si 4dr. it was smaller then what I wanted but in contrast it was not a bad</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>the civic is not much smaller than the legacy. with better resale out of all the cars I looked at. the civic has the best build quality of the bunch and the best handling with a good bit of safety in mind sta/trac control 6 airbags the ergonomics are great and simple a blast to drive at almost 200 hp</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having researched and reading reviews on the new Civic Si, I finally made the purchase. From the moment I took it off the lot, I had a beaming grin. This car loves to be driven. I couldn't wait to pass the 500 mile mark to really see what it was made out of. Honda really keeps the driver in mind when they made this car, from the adjustable leather steering wheel, short shifter, seat ergonomics, headrests, and high quality plastics and interior. I was also considering getting the mustang GT, Infiniti G35, and nissan 350Z, obviously sheer torque and horsepower surpass the Si, but as far as performance, reliability, and the joy of driving, the Si is hard to beat</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an excellent car. No doubt about it, Honda knows what they're doing with this car, well thought out and put together well. Very comfortable car to drive, easy handling, and supportive seats. A little road noise, but for a small car it is refined in so many other ways, who cares. Open the sunroof, and turn on the tunes. Also, the back seat is tight getting in and out of this coupe, but hey I'm driving so to bad for those back seat drivers. Economical on gas, and oil changes every 3000 miles, never a problem with this car. Owned almost a year now. It's a cool car, no regrets here. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Civic for my 80 mile round trip commute every day. It does the job very well but there have been a few issues that I didn't expect from a Honda (this is my first). The air conditioning failed (due to road debris?). Not covered by warranty for some reason. The tires wore out very fast and unevenly (upper rear control arms were replaced per tsb but not the tires). There were two recalls, one for rear bearings and the other for water pump pulley cracking. A rattle in the rear deck I fixed myself with foam rubber. Overall not bad, but more problems than I would expect from a new car. Still it is a competent commuter car and hasn't ever left me stranded. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fuel economy is excellent in my mostly highway driving. It will get 40 mpg plus if I keep my speed down, but I usually drive about 70 and it gets about 35 mpg at that speed. It is fairly quiet, handles well, has a good sound system and serves well as a commuter car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased this car used when the fuel prices were so high. Would have loved the Accord, but had to have the gas savings as I drive 40 miles 1 way to work. Disturbing to have loud road noise shortly after buying it & it was the rear control arms that also ruined the rear tires. Also had the visor break. Honda did take care of the problem, but now worried if we made a good decision buying a Honda. Fairly comfortable car but we were used to the ease of getting in/out of an small SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice looking car, fun to drive, nice interior. Like the safety features - six air bags & the braking is excellent. Loved getting between 38-41 mpg in the summer. Winter drops it to around 36 - but that is great for a car this size!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Probably the nicest Honda product I've owned, but you can feel that there was more cost-cutting here than in the past, as while there are more features, the car doesn't seem as sturdy as previous models. Also, there are some glitches like a notchy, recalcitrant third gear and the strange surge from drive-by-wire when cold and the car isn't as smooth to shift as past Hondas I've owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I can't pick one favorite that stands above others, so I'd just say that how much Honda offers on such a low-end model is impressive, such as VSC, Recaro seats, LSD, six-speed and that this car has the best handling of any of my previous cars, both Integras.</FAVORITE>

But I've had number of small problems with my 2007 Civic in just the first 18 months of ownership, and I fear these are signs of larger problems down the road. The A/C broke, driver-side sun visor broke, water-pump had a recall and needed to be replaced, and the car almost didn't start after sitting for just two days recently in 30 degree weather.

<TEXT>The split-level dash is awesome - almost like having a heads-up display. The car reads your mind on changing directions, and accelerates very un-Honda-like when desired. It's a little loud inside, and the ride is like that of a full-size truck, but overall it strikes an exceptional balance between sport and function, and gets 33 hwy MPG. In almost 8K miles so far, I've averaged better than 30 MPG overall - amazing, as I haven't babied it. The low torque (139 lb-ft) of the Si relative to turbocharged competitors was a feature, as it allows me to be far more smooth than while trying to second-guess a turbo. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Jekyll & Hyde - can be benign to drive when shifting under 3K RPM. But rev it up to 5800 (where VTEC kicks in) and it's a monster for 2200 RPM. Close ratio in 1st through 5th means shifting near the 8K redline puts you back in VTEC in the higher gear. Too much fun. Handles like a slot car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is just a great little ride for anyone. I had an S2K, but since it's convertible, I decided to go with something at least a little more practical. The fact that it's a Honda says a lot. High RPM, great reliability ratings, gas mileage, futuristic styling, and definitely the handling is precise, and the list goes on. I only have one complaint and that is rattling of something in the roof. It's possible that there might be a pebble or acorn or something that got sucked in while I was doing the sunroof back, but it is a very annoying problem. Also, the wheels seem to chip easy. I drive on gravel roads very little, but on two of my wheels, it is chipped.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dashboard (both red and blue backlights), iV-tec, audio system, exhaust system, upholstery, and even the gas mileage. It is by far the best in its class, and the most boring trip can become the funnest (and quickest)! The engine is a perfect match for the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With gas prices going up I saw the need to change vehicles. The old FWD Chrysler concord was a good vehicle, but avg 20 mpg. The Honda is stable to drive and better in snow that I expected. The fuel economy has offset much of the extra payment, and the resale $$ is much better. Call it Honda+ The brakes are solid and the engine is the smoothest 4 cyl I have ever felt. Good A/C, and sun roof. Bad item was the rear control arms that went bad or were poor design. They ruined the rear tires by 19,000 mi. They were replaced, but watch for this potential failing. All other aspects are excellent with enough room for me, @ 6'5".</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third civic. I must say that this one is my favorite. I have had the car for 10 days and have put nearly 1k miles on the odometer and the gas mileage is dead on. The comfort over my previous 04 model is greatly improved due to longer wheel base especially over bumps. The front seats appear to have more legroom which is always nice. Overall I am very satisfied with my car. I got a great deal on my new car and my last Civic a 2004 EX sedan with 52K miles only depreciated $3k. I have been able to trade about every 3 year and get a new car. I love the low depreciation, reliability, overall spunkiness and quality that I have not been able to find elsewhere.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is amazing. You can take corners recommended for speeds at no more than 25 MPH at 65, and right when the car is about to jump out of line your VSA kicks in and pulls you back. Snow tires are a must as grip plummets when icy or snowy. 1st and 2nd gears are very snappy and when the VTEC hits it makes the sound of a raging banshee. The bucket seats cradle you and the sound system is extremely nice; much nicer than my father's TSX and Mother's Ridgeline. The worst thing about the car is the 600 mile "keep it under 4 grand" break in! It's well worth it once you do start hitting the v-tec and the shift indicator is a nice addition. Overall a great car.</TEXT>

I really like the gauge layout, I'm not bothered by the emergency brake handle, and I've had several cars that I can't quite see the front of from inside. I was a little concerned about poor acceleration until I passed someone my first day with the car with no problem. I wasn't sure how it would do in the Minnesota cold...no problem. This car teaches you to drive efficiently. Mileage was around 50mpg when it was warmer, but dropped in the cold.

<TEXT>Owned for about a month, over 2000 miles so far. No problems. Wonderful balance of practicality and performance, economy and fun. Also impressed with IIHS's perfect crash test scores. I throughly enjoy driving this car. Marvelous automatic transmission. Even under hard acceleration, I can barely feel it shifting gears. My only gripe - this is the most uncomfortable driver's seat I've ever sat in. Headrest juts too far forward. Luckily, an '07 Accord headrest also fits into the the slots. For $90.00, that problem's fixed. Lower lumbar also juts too far forward, making for a painful back after a day of running errands around town. A towel shoved down into the seat fixed that problem.</TEXT>

The safety features are also incredible it has side airbags on all the doors. It makes me feel extremely safe. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is for my wife, she wanted an automatic 2 door that was fun and easy to drive. After test driving Mazda?s 3, it was obvious to us that the Civic was a better product, we put our order in for an Atomic Blue EX with Navi and got it 2.5 months later. This car is very nice, the short wheelbase is noticeable, but not annoying. The suspension and steering is tight and precise. It is very easy to drive, and backup, blind spots are minimal. The blue lights of the split dash are easy on the eyes, and the navigation system is simple to use and operate. This car has made me consider a Si for myself.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Don't buy. Unfindable can't-fix-it interior rattles & bumps and rough highway pavement. Balky starts from standstill - drivers new to car stall in traffic again and again. Seatbelt alarm makes punishing howl six times if one doesn't buckle up before starting car, so one must first open door with key, put down key down, buckle up, then pick up key and start car. Forget to do it and get punished by ugly noise. There is no sound insulation at all - hear every noise in wheel wells. Seat back mechanism to enter rear does not go back to position so seat backs must be readjusted each time. NO LUMBAR SUPPORT. Less than average directional stability. This car stinks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I never though i would be a civic owner. To bland etc.... However I now drive 140 miles a day and I had to think of gas cost and reliability. To sum up this car is great! Very comfortable to drive and responds well. For the size of the car it has pretty good pick up. There is wind noise at higher speeds (75-85). The Nav system is great. The interior seems surprisingly more spacious than our subaru. The dual dash does take a little time to get used to but I find that i now prefer it than the traditional displays. Gas mileage during the break in period has been between 30-36 mpg. And this is all highway driving. Although as you have seen above at higher than EPA speeds for determining MPG. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is great! fit and finish are also what I expected. The Nav is a great tool if used properly. reliability is a huge factor.</FAVORITE>

Curtain-side as well as front air bags, ABS, and electronic brake distribution add even more to the car's overall safety. It's fun to drive and it looks awesome.

<TEXT>It happened before I even got out of the dealership for a test drive. Lots of interior space, good visibility all around, striking dash layout, small steering wheel, quiet engine, smooth but firm ride, good acceleration, quiet cruise at 70. I ordered the metallic beige, 17" wheels (which are brown), side spoilers, rear spoiler, trunk spoiler, fog lights, full front "bra" cover, auto/day-nite mirror, leather steering wheel cover. A beautiful car. I easily removed the CIVIC nameplate from the trunk and it looks $10,000 more expensive. It's a head-turner. I even got 8 yr. extended warranty plus interior/exterior/undercarriage protection. Ended up being $8,000 more than base...but worth it</TEXT>

<TEXT>The new civic is a substantial improvement over the last design. I traded in my 99 SI civic for this one and I like the new car. I once owned a 1980 Civic that was fun to drive and rode 50 miles to the gallon. This car is way bigger than that was, but also feels much more luxurious than the 99. Yeah, it's not a $50,000 BMW, but I wanted a car that gets at least 35 MPG highway, so compare it to that field. The civic is much more interesting than a Corolla. The Mazda 3 is a worthy alternative, and you won't see quite so many either, but the new honda is very smooth. Honda has always been known for making quality engines, and this one very refined. Great fit and finish, don't buy any extra</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Honda. Purchased the '07 Civic EX w/ Navi about 2 weeks ago. Have loved every second I spend behind the wheel. Just took the little 4 cyl into the Blue Ridge mountains, and it performed admirably. The redesign Honda has done on the Civics is beautiful. Plenty of room in the front seats for adults, back seat is fine for kids. The NAVI system is AWESOME! It has already paid for itself! XM sounds great, moon roof works smooth. Steering is precise, braking is tight. Acceleration leaves a bit to be desired, but is compensated for by gas mileage. Golf clubs fit easily in the trunk. I really, really love this car. It's size is perfect and it's fun and easy to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a CRV earlier this summer, and was blown away by the quality and performance. When my second car spontaneously combusted, I decided to replace it with a civic. My initial motivation was the gas milage (as it was with the CRV), but I've been truly impressed with the performance (While it isn't as fast as my old turbo beetle, it gets superior gas mileage, and isn't as fear inspiring as the Volvo was when entering the freeway), as well as the ergonomics.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great fuel economy, only been thru one tank of gas, and average was 33.5 MPG. Handles well. Wish the LX had better wheels, but not at the $2000 price for the EX. My kids think it is the greatest, they like riding in it much more than in the minivan (me too). The interior is great, I love the fact that the CD player will also play MP3s and WMAs. Takes some getting used to the speedometer display, it can be too bright at times, and if adjusted not bright enough at other times, but it is very easy to adjust. I am tall, and on the first day I owned it, I hit my knee on the emergency brake handle while getting in, it took part of the paint off of the button, but no big deal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The EX Coupe is not only technically sophisticated but is aesthetically pleasing both inside and out. The i-VTEC engine delivers more than adequate acceleration and its 1.8 liter size provides excellent mileage. Moreover, the content in the EX is astonishing for the price. It is like having a luxury car--a mini-Acura--for under $20K. All the convenience items are there, and some you don't expect, like speed sensitive stereo volume control and speed sensitive intermittent wipers. And despite some carps, the dual tier dash is a brilliant design. Speed can be monitored without deflecting your eyes too far down and yet the tachometer is mounted dead center, where it should be.

<TEXT>We traded in my 02 Maxima for this car. We needed less payments and more fuel economy and that's exactly what we got. Does it have the power to blow past people like the maxima, no but it has good pick up and I guess if you wanted to add some mods it would be able to do that. It's fun, very roomy for a sub compact and the side airbags make me feel like my wife is better protected. Good car for the cost, we only have 300 miles on it so reliabbility still stands to be seen but Honda has a good reputation.</TEXT>

Slight decrease on the EPA ratings 49/51 are to be expected as we live in an area that has a lot of hills. Our HCH has a Thule Roof Rack and generally have surfboards on them most of the time.

Interior plastic is a little cheap, it scuffs easily and I dented the door where I rest my elbow. Vehicle stability assist has kicked in a couple of times in the snow and it helped with the traction.

<TEXT>I takes a while to get used to this gem of a vehicle. The electric motor acts like a turbo to assist the gas motor. I've had a few rattles and a window motor recall, but I've been thrilled with the 36,000 miles I've put on it thus far. Handling is superb. I can spin the tires, but I wish I could get a larger electric motor as an option to help with the 1800 ft. peak I drive over twice daily on my 45 mile commute. Mileage is controversial with this car; people report all kinds. For me, if I don't watch what I'm doing, I get a combined 42 mpg (over the last 2000 miles). If I pay attention, and keep the revs below 2500, I can easily get low 50's mpg. If I draft a semi, I can get over 70!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 2007 Civic EX (as much, if not more than my previous 1986 and 1998 models). Civics are well made, and the 2007 model has improved handling, better safety features, and excellent gas mileage. The sleek style makes it a handsome car to look at too ("pretty" for the ladies) They're great on short trips to the grocery store and on weekend road trips. I can fill up the tank in Miami on a Friday morning, drive to Orlando without stopping, and still have half a tank of gas left when I get there. I'll drive around Orlando all weekend and won't need to refuel until I'm halfway back to Miami. That's great mileage. It translates into great value. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When car shopping, I found this vehicle to be the perfect combination of economy, performance, comfort, style, reliability and cost. I narrowed my search to Nissan Maxima and Honda Civic Si. The final battle was won for Honda when I found this car as Certified Pre-Owned with 100k warranty. A great car for a small family. Keeping the RPM between 3-5k makes for a civil driving experience in the city with respectable fuel mileage. Kick'r up to 7 or 8k when you want VTEC to come out and play.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the two tier dash and interior styling as a whole. The stereo is quite nice and the sub can actually sustain extremely low tones.

<TEXT>Got this car after my 07 Camry got totaled. Like the title of my review says, you really can't go wrong Civic if you are looking for a well built affordable coupe or sedan. I'm 26 and exterior looks matter a lot to me. Civic Coupe LX in nighthawk black looks really sharp, and I got whole bunch of compliments on the looks after I changed the factory wheels with aftermarket alloys. The coupe is fun to drive and is also very comfortable. The interior design is very interesting, and stock stereo system is pretty decent. Healthy 1.8 L engine gives you very good fuel economy without compromising performance. You are not going to get bored with this car for awhile(coupe, not sure about sedan)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks are my favorite feature, exterior and interior both. Fuel economy is amazing, I just filled up gas before coming home and I got 356.3 miles out of 10.826 gallons. That's almost 33 mpg with 60% highway, 40% city (with some A/C).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had our Civic lx (4dr a/t) for a year and a half, 26,000 miles on it. The car is quiet with very little road noise. Gas mileage is not as advertised on the window sticker (30 city 40 hwy). Rather I'm getting about 24 mpg combined city/hwy feathering the gas pedal. The gas mileage got better after 18 or 19,000 miles, averaging 28 mpg combined. After about 20,000 miles the bumps and holes feel harsher. As the car racks up miles the fuel economy gets better but ride quality doesn't. The driver's side sun visor split in half and, it didn't want to stay closed it was replaced under warranty. Overall the car is fun to drive with zippy handling and performance. Interior and exterior design is great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Honda NEW in January 2007. Over the last several months, my car has been in the shop several times, and I have missed four days of work due to the vehicle being incapacitated by mechanical failures. The list of failed parts is long: 1. Sun Visor split apart 2. Battery #1 3. Battery #2 4. Battery #3 5. Air compressor relay 6. High road force on tires 7. Air condenser (mysterious road pebble) 8.

<TEXT>I have 15k on the car. AIR CONDITIONING IS HORRIBLE. I live in Colorado where we have had 20 days of 90+ heat. And when I drive the car home, the AC STOPS BLOWING COLD AIR whenever the car is stopped (w or w/o autostop). Honda manufacturing & my local dealer have confirmed "THIS IS THE WAY THE CAR IS DESIGNED. In order to get the AC to blow cold air, the engine must be above a certain RPM." Do you have any idea how uncomfortable it is to be sitting in the blazing sun at 5200 ft with no AC? It sucks. That's why I bought a car WITH AC. Turns out I must rev at the stoplights to have AC. Really disappointed with Honda. wish I had known this before buying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had "Spunky" for less than a year now. Blessings and curses with this metallic blue 2007 Civic sedan are the topic. Inside & outside, this car looks and feels sweet. Sporty yet business worthy, family functional yet mid-life crisis soothing, fuel efficient yet spunky -- I thought this car had it all! The blessings are exactly what Honda would have you to realize...save a buck and fly like a buck through the woods! The curses? Wheel seals to rims: constantly failing while parked on slight lateral inclines. Major cost issue (not under warranty!): the under-carriage shield/bumper assembly fails to clear wheel stops in parking lots causing it to gradually break joints and disengage. Bad!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>While aerodynamic and, therefore, economical, I'm not sure the design team tried to parallel park this car or do any mundane tasks. It is impossible to "see"any corners when parking. Today I tried to replace my NYS registration sticker in the lower left corner of the front window. I am going to have to make a trip to the dealer's to get the old sticker glue off as I cannot get my hand/fingers in to razor off the old glue.Guess I should add the extra trip to my gas mileage rating! Perhaps Consumer Reports should hire non-car people to review cars. This is my 3rd Honda Civic and MY LAST. Wish I could get a call from the design team or Consumer Reports.

<TEXT>Just turned 10,000 miles on our 2007 Civic Hybrid. After having for about 8 months now I've grown to appreciate the car and what it offers. First, I find it comfortable and I'm over 6 foot. The AC systems works well. Ride remains good, although there is some road noise. I find the engine peppy for what it is, and that is a gas saver. You want fast acceleration - buy a Corvette. This car will go easily with the pack. Recent 1,200 mile trip averaged 47+ and 48.11 on the way home. And I ran with traffic. Car likes to be on cruise control. About 60MPH is the best speed to max fuel economy. I keep tires pumped to 33PSI and I use 5w20 synthetic oil. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Since purchasing the Civic, we've experienced our share of problems. First, bolts were missing from the lower air dam underneath the front bumper. Weather stripping coming off the rear passenger side window and the air conditioning falls short. At a dead stop in traffic the a/c shuts down and starts blowing hot air. During accelerations it also shuts down and blows hot air. Very uncomfortable to say the least. We had to tint the windows just to stay cool. Honda says it a new design to regulate the power on the engine. If we would have known, we never would have bought it. Funny, my 06' Acura TL (Honda product) never did that. </TEXT>

I was told that the drive belt needed to be adjusted (?), the car was still making the noise. Now about 8 months later, my a/c will not blow cold air nor will the compressor or clutch engage.I was told that something must have punctured my compressor and the freon has leaked out and neither Honda or my extended warranty will cover the damage because it is considered a road hazard and my fault.

<TEXT>I am 41 yrs old and purchased my Civic 1 year ago yesterday and it is the best car I've owned. I drive 75 to 80 highway miles to work each day and truly enjoy the ride and definitely the fuel economy. I travel above the speed limit and still average above 32 mpg and when I decide to take it easy, it averages around 36-38 mpg. The Bridgestone tires are not as bad as some may believe, I have 26K on the factory set and have rotated at every oil change (every 8,200k) and they still look to have at least 50% tread remaining. The 1.8 L engine provides great economy, a quiet ride and will surprise you on the open road as to how fast you approach that third digit on the speedometer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car needs new tires due to a factory defect, it has always bounced down the road, now, we know why. It now needs a rear upper control arm kit. The company will pro rate the tires, using some sort of formula, based on tire depth and mileage. We were told by our dealer that there is no pro-rated money allowed based on the formula.

All HCS offered to do was give a loaner car while I kept my SI at the dealer for a few days in the hope that they would admit to the problem. But they just didn't want to fix it. I traded in the car. I'll never buy another Honda again. This was my fifth. It was in the shop constantly, first for the oil leak, which took months of visits and letters/calls to Honda to get fixed. And I got tired of trying to get the 3rd gear issue fixed. Don't buy one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There are many things I love about this car, its engine, 6 speed, wheels and handling. It is also comfortable and quiet on trips. It is very reliable, with no problems over the past year. In fact, it feels like a mini-Acura TL-S Type. My one complaint is the gas mileage. I can only get about 32 at highway speeds and that's if I keep it at 70 and below. Not an easy thing to do in this car because speed comes on quickly and keeps climbing. its easy to do 90 MPH. Love the interior but hate that you can only get black interior. It is very hot in a car with so much glass. It also shows lint like crazy. Radio is good too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Honda is not unlike its predecessors in being a quality, reliable ride, equipped with only the most necessary bells a whistles to ensure repairs remain inexpensive. Overall, it's a quality car that is easy to drive with a above-Honda-average amount of pick-up. Comfort is an issue for the tall, as has always been the case. My only real complaint is that the interior materials seem cheap, easily showing scratches, wear, oil, and dirt. This is especially worrisome for any leaser.

<TEXT>I've owned this car for more than a year now. I drive a lot of highway and city mix miles and this car has performed excellent in both city and highway with one exception. The factory Bridgestone tires are absolute pieces of junk and wore out at 17,000 miles. Honda seems to have realized this as the latest Civics I've seen have Goodyear tires on them. Other than the tires, the car accelerates nicely and is fairly comfortable for two average sized people. The fuel mileage ranges in the 33-34 MPG area no matter how I drive, and I don't drive conservatively. The stereo is excellent as long as you don't want to install XM Radio. That will cost you $500 if you can find someone to do it.</TEXT>

I bought this car because of the great fuel efficiency it was supposed to have and it has not met my expectations. I was told that it would average around 28 city and highway combined. I have not seen 24 or higher yet. Of course they told me that the engine needs to be worked in and then I will get better gas mileage but after 6000 miles I have seen anything yet. I also saw someone else on a discussion board say they recommend 10-15k before you see better gas mileage. My lease will be up before then. I am very disappointed in Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>One year into ownership, purchased it new. I've owned 3 previous Hondas and 1 Acura so I thought it would be a no brainer. The ride is pretty rough, the steering and handling is excellent. The seats really are not bad at all, a 2 hour trip to LA and back is not difficult for a compact. My mileage is around 325 per tank. I drive it kinda hard, my last car was a VR6 GTI and I MISS THAT CAR for the overall driving experience. I have 16K on this one. Drivers side visor just broke and I hardly use it. Automatic transmission was not a good choice for this size engine, not smooth and robs power. I'm a stick guy anyway, oh well.

<TEXT>As for blind spots: the B-pillar is thick, but the rear passenger windows allow for more than ample eye sight (these are things you notice on a test drive, not 2 months later!). As for the quality ext./int. yes its cheaper, but for the price the quality is more than sufficient, and the design is quite nice. Go look at Chevy and tell me you don't love Honda interiors. Performance wise, this is sufficient, but definitely not sporty. The engine has 140 hp@6300, and 128 lb-ft@4300. So really, I've no complaints about this car, and have been quite happy with its MPG. I recommend it to any one needing an economical car that is almost guaranteed to last 300,000+ miles if you care for it. </TEXT>

The Civic body styling is light years ahead of the older Civic along with the functionality too. Only one complaint to those who are 5'10" or taller.
