<TEXT>I'm not an easy sale, which is part of the reason why even though I love this car so much that I do not give it all 10's as the purpose of this is to inform you and not brag about how great of a car this is. The car looks great stock but lacks the power that I personally desire. Easily fixed though with very accessible modifications that you can do. Interior quality can be improved but leave the exterior alone as it looks the way it should. The Handling is great and it behaves like a muscle car is supposed to. Definitely recommend getting an aftermarket intake, exhaust and a custom tune otherwise don't expect to blow by other cars in it's class with ease. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Solid engine, great looking, acts the way a muscle car should act, very easy to access aftermarket upgrades for this car. I am a big guy and this car SHOCKED me with the amount of front seat space. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The engine in this car really surprised me when I test drove it. Quite a bit more power than the older 6's. I have not had any real problems with it yet and the engine seems really solid. When I hit bumps or turn the music up I do get a rattle from either the mirror or the door handle, but I have heard the same from alot of S197 owners. Overall this is a great daily driver and pretty fun. However if you live somewhere with snow, it probably isn't a great choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the retro styling on the exterior. The pony package is well worth the money. I test drove auto and manual and the auto can't even compare. It feels alot weaker to me. The traction control is great in the rain. It should be standard. Pirelli tires are a nice touch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Mustang over 2 years now and it is lucky #13. I have been driving Mustangs since 1988. Out of the 13 I have owned only one was a lemon, a 2004 which I bought as a left over, but this 2007 has been spectacular just like the previous 11 models with no issues. While the interior feels like a cockpit and more room was given for taller drivers in the 05 redesigns, it could still use some work. The center console could be a little smaller. Handling is nice with the 18" wheel package. My model also has the 3.55 rear axle. I drive a basic deluxe, the only options were the 3.55 rear, upgraded dash, and the 18" wheels, otherwise barebones, and I love it. Over this is fun car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The premium Dash, and the pick from the start line. The 5 speed manual transmission. This car will get from 0- 60 in just over 5 seconds. And the growl from the dual exhaust powered by the 4.6L 3v V8 is music to my ears</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First of all, I absolutely loved the look of my 2007 Mustang, v6 Premium with Pony Package and Interior upgrade. It looked awesome. Unfortunately, the interior was plagued with rattles the dealer couldn't fix, and any driver who knows what I normal suspension should sound like would know that this car suffers from serious design flaws in the form of loud suspension clunks in the undercarriage. It sounds like bottom is gonna fall out on uneven surfaces. It also had terrible traction without the traction control upgrade, and I felt unsafe driving in rain. Wanted to love it, but had to get rid of it 6 months later and took a huge hit. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Shaker stereo system is great. Great exhaust sound for a V-6, looks sharp</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great looking but practical sports car, with very good performance and a gorgeous noise. My wife (who is old enough to know better) floors the pedal just for the noise. Pin sharp handling that gives a whole new meaning to "I'm just popping to the Post Office" - it is rather an interesting little road with some good bends. I have to slow down for the straights! Excellent value for money and amazingly reasonable to insure. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from a '97 Cobra that literally shook itself apart over each bump or road ripple and had one problem after another. So it was a pleasant surprise to see there's at least as much if not more power, the ride quality is 1000% better, and it sounds almost as good as the Cobra. Cobra sounded big and mean with a lot of rumbles, GT sounds big and clean without much of that V8 rumbling which I miss a bit - close, but not quite the same. Build quality I have yet to determine as I'm only into day 3 and haven't really hit any nasty bumps where things start to come loose. So far it seems very well built, no rattles or loose parts yet. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Shifter is sweet and easy. Miles to go before empty and average MPG readout is very useful with this kind of gas guzzler.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second GT, the first was a '99 GT. Specs Acceleration is good and the handling is much improved over the last model. The gear shift is located properly (finally) and the interior is quite attractive with the upgrade. I got the dark alluminum trim with a black interior, and I think it looks great. Last GT had parchment interior and showed alot more dirt and age after 5+ years than friends with black interiors. Rear seat is almost useless for anything other than a package shelf. Trunk is a nice size but the trunk opening makes placing larger items inside tricky. Very happy with my purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style, the car look looks great inside and out. Chassis, great handling car but still a muscle car with lots of push. I also love the aftermarket support for the platform in regards to performance. 300 hp is a nice start but this car needs at least 400 at the wheels.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In all honesty it isnt easy buying a car now days! It's hard to decide if you want a new muscle car which really ony gives you the option of the Mustang, or to go with a foriegn to get the mileage. I've got 1500 miles and am extremely happy. The car gives you a road race ready experience. The automatic has virtually no problems. The shifts are so quick it's unbelievable, and once you get those tires smokin' you better hope you're in a parking lot because it's all over the place.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The quality is superb, the interior comfy, back seats a bit tight. This thing is super. I highly recommend that anyone looking for a convertible test drive this car last. Fully decked out, it was still $8000 less than the EOS, and the convertible top is flawless. You might like the looks of the Vette, as we have, from the outside, but here the looks are inside too, great seating, and be careful for that accelerator pedal!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After just a couple weeks the car is nice. Finally got my long awaited Mustang. I own a 1954 Conv 289 4vv with a 3 speed, the 07 blows the car away in speed and comfort. it's more fun to drive, but workmanship shows why the American car companies are losing business. Fit and finish are OK at best.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car less than 2 months and it has been in the shop for repair 2 times. The passenger door continues to rattle, even after putting a new anit-rattle pin in the door twice. The passenger car door speaker had to be replace due to internal wire issues and the open and close door switch too. Also, they had to replace the mechanism that open the doors when you press the car remote. Now, I am having serious second thoughts about my purchase. However, I must say that my car dealer has really tried to fix all of the issues with the car. I think it was poorly built at the manufacture. I will be back at the dealer today, wish me luck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own a 01' Vette and I needed an everyday driver. I wanted another sports car that's fun and reliable. To my surprise, the Mustang GT delivered. Before turning the car on, I couldn't believe how comfortable the seats were. The seating position was just perfect, as well as the location of the 5 speed shifter. I can not emphasize enough how smooth the 5 speed transmission is. I'm in awe. The interior is well crafted aside from the plastic pieces. The chrome and aluminum accents are favorable. Now to the performance. Let me tell you, this thing goes and that's coming from a Vette owner. The sound/rumble of the 300 V8 is fantastic. I'm happy with my decision on this vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable seats, the rumble, fantastic visibility, and a really slick 5-speed [a lot more smooth than my Vette]; HIGH RESIDUAL VALUE - Good overall investment. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was a well thought out purchase, after test driving the Mazda RX-8, 350-Z and Vette. I was very surprised at how well Ford had done with the Mustang GT; the handling and horsepower are a far cry from the earlier models. I almost did not consider this car, I am so glad I did. Please understand if I could afford a new Vette it would be in my driveway, but for $15,000+ difference the Mustang GT wins. Take one for a test drive I bet it will end up in your driveway!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to add another hot rod for my garage so I purchased a 2007 Mustang GT, it would be good company for my 2005 GTO...it ended up as a poor choice. The GT has a much harsher ride, interior looks cheap and steering is a little sluggish. It does sound great at all speeds but with 300 HP I expected more of a rush when I jump on the gas. Compared to my GTO this car feels like it is pulling or carrying a trailer behind it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my car for about 3 months now and I still get excited about driving it anywhere! There is NOTHING in this price range that touches it either especially with the demise of the Camaro and Firebird. I can't tell you how many people have stopped me at the gas station to ask about my car or even at a stop light, commenting on how nice the car looks. I get about 18- 22 MPG driving in about 50% heavy traffic and 50% highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is Vista blue with white racing stripes and 18" wheels. It drives like a kitten or a tiger, that's up to you, petal to the metal and the auto trans shifts at red-line. No loss of time for the auto in acceleration vs the 5 speed manual. I love this car. I suggest all options except for the hood scoop (serves no practical purpose and creates drag), the 1000 watt stereo and the convertible--both of which are over-priced in my opinion. The sound of the exhaust and the acceleration of this car for under $30,000 dollars cannot be achieved with any other car. I cannot believe it every time I drive it. It is plain fun. Drive it and you will buy it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Horrible experience. Bought this car brand new on Tuesday. 36 hours and only 115 miles on the odometer I am broken down on the road. Car needs a new rear (gears are shot) and a new transmission. Dealer would not provide a loaner car without paying for it. And roadside assistance took over 3 hours on a beautiful sunny day in NJ. How does a brand new car have soooooo many problems. It is unacceptable. The car is going to take 2 weeks to fix. And in case anyone is wondering it is not driver related. This happened at highway speeds in 5th gear. Horrible sounds and smoke coming inside through the vents. Will never buy a FORD again.</TEXT>

Performance with 18" tires is superb. Five speed shifting is smooth and solid. Front seats are extremely comfortable and supportive. Not a squeak or rattle - very tight. Couldn't find a defect on delivery. The gauge display is pure retro, but the color options are an up to date touch. Driving has never been this much fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Given the $26K price tag, this is a fun car to drive back and forth to work. Yes, it?s not built like the expensive sport cars (I also drive a Porsche C4S), but it has the muscle and get up and go you would expect from our Dad?s old throw back muscle cars. If you?re looking for a superior quality sports car at $26K, forget it. If you?re looking for something to have fun with and get your heart rate up as you floor the accelerator, the Mustang GT will do the trick. I purchased the California Package and love the extras. Besides, there?s an enormous amount of extras you can purchase to personalize your Mustang in performance and styling. Love the car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>For us older baby-boomers Mustangs are well known as an iconic class of car. Until 2005 Mustangs had been gradually & pathetically compromised by quality and design beginning in the mid seventies. Now we have the best of both worlds, new age technology, cutting edge performance and classic design. Yes, they have cut a few corners, big deal. This particular design window and the features available has made this one of the new generation of collector cars. Somebody at Ford finally got "it." From the growl of the engine, to the stereo system, to the custom wheels and all the technology in between, it is everything we could never of dreamed up in the 60's. The most FUN! car I have ever owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design is a compelling retro style-flawlessly melds the 60's with the 21st century. Very rapid stop to 60 acceleration and cruises at 80mph. 5 speed shifts very smoothly. Interior seating is sports car comfortable and the leather is smooth and tight. This car is an absolute joy to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 4th car in two years; I've had an Accord, an 86 Camaro, a Camry, and now this and I LOVE IT! It's as fast as my V8 Camaro was and the handling is impeccable. I live in Colorado and it even does well in icy conditions given my previous training with rear-wheel drive. The interior is comfortable and smart looking and the exterior is simply HOT. Gas mileage is decent at around 21 mpg compared to 14 mpg in my similar performing V8 Camaro. Though only complaint I have to say quip about is the quality; I've had it since November and it squeaks like a wild horse. I played the stereo too loud and now the glass in the side view mirrors is loose and rattles! The cheap plastic can cut you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior and exterior design, comfort, Shaker stereo system is the best I've ever seen, some very clever convenience features, FAST, good gas mileage for a sports car, excellent winter performance. The best, most well-thought out, Ford product in a long time.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is junk. The quality of this vehicle is so substandard that they left a 3" unsealed seam that lets water in causing electrical system failures and the car to become such a mildewed, mold covered stinking mess that Ford dealers won't even take the car as trade in. (Not an isolated incident. Search "2005-2007 MUSTANG LEAKS" and watch what you find.) Ford finds this kind of defect acceptable. They will patch it and send you on your way, regardless of any other damage that might have occurred). If you anticipate customer service and any assistance from Ford, don't hold your breath. These cars come with a taillight warranty, when they can't see your taillights your warranty is over.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Makes an attractive over priced paperweight. It an absolutely great place to grow mold. If you like the smell of mildew in your expensive convertible, this car is a MUST have.

<TEXT>As I am fast approaching my 60th birthday, it is nowhere near as fast as the 4.9 seconds it takes this Mustang GT to reach 60. Telling ya, I have been driving Ford trucks and SUV's for over thirty years and finally I bought a vehicle for the pure fun of driving it. When you crank it up the first thing you sense is a low rumbling growl generated from a 300HP OHC engine. By the time you put it into 4th gear you are going 70MPH at 2000 RPM. That's power. Add a little "Rolling Stones" on the Shaker 500 sound system and life takes on a whole new glow. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I miss my Mustang so bad. I bought it before I deployed to the Middle East. So, I can't wait to get back on it because it was a very, very smooth ride and easy to handle. I also enjoyed the Shaker 500 music stereo sound. It really felt like I was in another world when I drove it. If you want to drive a great looking American car for great price get a Mustang!

<TEXT>Have owned an Alloy-colored V6 Mustang coupe for three months. Overall very pleased and recommend this vehicle to most potential buyers, given it is a two-door non-hatchback only for someone who regularly transports themselves and one other person. Quick, responsive, quiet, and reliable with dedicated professional dealer service. Driver position cramped, making ingress/egress difficult even for a slender person. Blower fan noisy at positions 3 and 4. Trunk access limited with narrow lid. Back seats only for small children and access difficult. BUT, it's a great looking sporty car at reasonable price and very fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Most positive traits: ride, power, simplicity, and looks. Going from a 4- cylinder Camry to this V6 'stang, am very satisfied with acceleration and handling. Traction in the rain on asphalt has been fine. We'll see come winter. Visibility/dash readouts/gauges/stereo/ergonomics excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 07 last July. It is the best car I have ever owned. It has superb handling, great acceleration,a terrific rumble from its V-8 and twin pipes, wonderful stability at even VERY high speeds, and one of the best engine/transmission combos I have seen in any car, domestic or imported -- and it's got that great retro Mustang look. If American car makers would build all their cars as they have this one, the imports would be in full retreat. I bought it for my wife and haven't let her touch it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I enjoy driving the Mustang except for a whining noise from the manual transmission in 5th gear and pulling positive torque. No noise when not under acceleration or slowing down. This is my third Mustang and the previous '88 and '95 both with the 5 speed manual did not make any noise like this. The dealership mechanic and the owner of the dealership both drove the car and both acknowledge the noisy gear whine but Ford wants more info from them comparing the noise with another new 5 speed manual transmission in another car. This transmission was flawed right from the first mile and should have been immediately repaired or replaced. Needless to say I am very disappointed with Ford and their quality.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>&#039;07 Mustang GT</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>2 weeks of ownership and I love this car. This new model is COMPLETELY different from the previous Mustang. I love starting up the car & hearing the V8 engine roar. A friend of mine who has a Prius sat in the driver's seat & started the car and loved it, and chuckled & laughed all the way to his Toyota. The car is very tight, no weird noises or anything. The ride is comfortable, easy to drive around town and feel good. The engine has plenty of power & sounds awesome. The engine sound reminds me of my old '70 Mach 1 and '70 Trans Am. The handling is good, much better than any Mustang I have owned in the past. The seats are comfortable and the a/c is cold. Cool, very cool car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable ride with great V8 sound (not too intrusive), good handling, great looking. The Shaker 1000 stereo is very powerful. You don't have to reach anymore to shift the car like the previous Mustang model. The shifter is short, precise and fun.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Mustang is really nice. The interior is a little cheap. Automatic transmission takes a while to down shift; likes to get in the high gear asap. The v8 sounds good, has all the power you need. Does not feel like 300 hp to me though; more like 230 hp. I have had mine to get a miss in the engine when I accelerate and turn; could be the traction control kicking in to stop me from spinning but not sure. Have to take it up with the dealer when I get my oil change which is every 5000 miles due to synthetic oil. But overall I am happy with the car. If you like to do adds for horsepower this is a good car - lot of add ons available.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ford has finally got something right. The first car I ever owned was a Mustang. Now, I feel like a kid again. The body style and interior are what a Mustang should be.The gauges are big and bold. The added feature of choosing the color light on the gauges is a very nice touch. All the controls are very easy to reach and operate. The sound system is much improved.The horsepower is awesome. By disengaging the "Traction Control", the car will bark when shifting even though mine is an automatic. When traveling at high speeds the car holds the road very well, as it does cornering. The ride is very comfortable, and the driver has ample room. Overall, this car is a blast to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my pony! I ordered a Windveil blue convertible with parchment top and leather interior same color with comfort package (new for 2007). Also added an interior upgrade. I wanted to brighten up the inside as much as possible, not a big fan of black, but the black that is there looks great! Oh, Pony package of course. This car is awesome! She gets looks everywhere she goes. So much fun with the top down. My salesman said to order the boot that goes over the top when it's down. It helps keep it clean when the top is down for an extended period of time. It's also expensive to add the hardware for it to the car if you decide you want it later. If you have cats, invest in a car cover.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound of the engine for a V6 is incredible. Awesome acceleration, plenty of power for this girl. The color combination of the Windveil blue and parchment is gorgeous.

<TEXT>I just loved the look of the 2005+ Mustangs when they came out. Finally I got a 2007 GT in 2008. Pros: Great styling inside and out. Has that great V8 muscle car sound and feel that makes it fun to drive. Cons: What is standard trim on most cars like aluminum accents and painted mirrors and such would cost many hundreds of dollars to get for the mustang as aftermarket parts. Engineering and build quality is very poor - 2005 to 2009 mustangs plagued with many problems including stalling, water leaks, suspension clunks, interior rattles, freezing e-brakes, etc. etc. Not a car for where it gets below freezing or rains a lot. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The retro look of it inside and out. Muscle car feel and very fun to drive. Makes you feel you are driving a true icon of the American Free Spirit and a testament to brute American Muscle.

<TEXT>I drive this car in the Chicago area. Winter is not a problem as long as you slow down. When gas was $4 I slowed down and got 25 to 28 MPG in mixed driving.(70% hiway, 30%city) I had to replace the radio (shaker 500) for a minor fault (NC at dealer). The car is plenty fast and a thrill to drive. I have louvers on the rear windows and I'm putting on axle back exhaust to create 10 more HP and an even better sound, also coming is a cold air intake. The car is alloy in color and it turns heads where ever I drive. I cannot recommend it enough if you are looking for a reasonably priced sports car. I'll definitely buy another one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Being a Mustang owner since 1965 it is much easier for me to offer an accurate view of this new car. We just bout a new '07 coupe with Pony Package. Yes, it is an unsold 07 in 2009! However, because it was two years old we got an unbelieveable deal! Engine is strong, stronger than any six before. Has a powerful throaty exhaust tone. It really scoots too! More power than either of us need. Everything that is good about a Mustang is great in this one. It still has many of the negatives too, like poor winter driving qualities, but, old veteran Mustang guy like me have learned to drive these over the years and I for one, have no trouble driving any Mustang in the winter. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Of course, the look is timeless. The Pony grille is certainly the most distinct feature. I thing the Pony grille should go on the GT's too! The dash is cool, but a bit too space age for my taste. </FAVORITE>

I have had a little trouble with it randomly dying and the dealership/Ford itself can't figure it out. My car just randomly dies. I have been going up a hill and it locks up/dies or just at a stop light and it dies. Once I put it into park it will fire right up and drive fine for like 6 months. Or it may die again in like another 3 mths. or 2 weeks, It's very random! Wish they could figure it out & fix it! Other then that I love the car. Very fun to drive.

<TEXT>I first drove a 05 Mustang V6 and after that I just had to own the new style Mustang. My 07 GT convertible is a real blast to drive. Can't decide whether to listen to the exhaust or the 500 watt stereo. Like other comments the gas mileage, acceleration, and handling is superb in this car. This is a true muscle car in my opinion. The 300 HP v8 engine has plenty of power. Mine is the torch red color with the hood scoop option. I get comments all the time about the looks of it. No rattles or problems since I got it new and its just over 2 years old now. Will keep this car for a long time. Paint quality is super on mine. I have keep everything stock on it for now.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fun to drive factor. The rumble of the v8 exhaust when accelerating or downshifting especially with the top down. The leather seats are very comfortable on a long trip.

<TEXT>Overall I love my Mustang GT. It's very fun to drive and makes a great daily driver. The style, performance, and sound can't be beat for the price. I drive mine year-round and only the worst snow storms will slow it down. It also gets decent gas mileage when driven with respect. I constantly get around 30 MPG on the highway and 18 MPG with mixed driving. My only complaint is the build quality could stand to be improved. I've brought it to the dealer numerous times to have various parts replaced. None were serious, mostly just to fix rattles, clunks or other odd noises the car was making. Other than that the car has been reliable for the two years I've owned it.</TEXT>

Granted I live in Chicago and probably shouldn't have bought it as my main car, but didn't think it would be as bad as it is. Spun out twice and had no control of the car after we had some snow in the area. Currently looking for a new car, but this car doesn't hold value.

After 10,000 miles had to get rear brake pads replaced and they still squeak! Plastic interior rattles at times, the auto shifter is cheap. The engine is solid. Keep getting misfiring pistons at start up, even after tune up and new spark plugs. Engine is very reliable, steering is excellent. Don't expect to be able to do any improvements since it'll violate warranty.

<TEXT>I've had my 07 GT for well over a year now and love the car and driving experience.

The car's been out a few years now, but it still attract attention and conversation most places I go. I don't drive the car hard nor do I drive it passive.

<TEXT>This is a really fun car to drive! One thing that helped this car tremendously in handling was an Eibach lowering kit - before lowering it the car would get some serious body roll in the turns. After lowering it I sacrificed some of the cushy ride, but owning a Mustang isn't about being cushy! The delayed throttle response due to the fly-by-wire technology is a little strange to get used to, but can be compensated for by adding a hydrogen assist kit - supposed to help with gas mileage (and it does by about 1-2 mpg), but in this car with a tune it actually added about 12-15 hp, which seems to all come in during the low rpms, improving throttle response and the 'seat of your pants' launch.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Convertible is a lot of fun. Used several times in parades and has been absolutely perfect for it. The 5- speed automatic is absolutely the best! After test driving both the manual and automatic, I ordered mine with the automatic because it felt faster - and I've driven/raced manuals for years!</FAVORITE>

For a car that cost $29,000 with only 16K miles and less than 2 years old I was offered 18K by the dealership. So I'm stuck with a nice car that didn't hold up it's value at all. </TEXT>

The body style of the 2007 coupe has a strong nostolgia effect, but that is where the comparison stops. The 07 is so superior to the original it cant be put into words in such a small space. I normally ride a motorcycle (FJR 1300) and love to ride at speed on a twisty mountain road. I never thought I would, or could have as much fun on the same roads in a car. Well, I am smiling now just thinking about it. Sweet memories, sweeter reality. Thank you Ford for continuing this magnificent line.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rock solid engine with a throaty muscular rumble exiting through dual exhaust. Beautiful body styling. Smooth efficient shifting. Keyless entry with a trunk release on the remote. Shaker sount system. Leather seats. Remarkable handling on those twisty mountain roads</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven 2 Altimas & a Corolla before this vehicle. Big step up in 'fun factor' and performance. I don't know of any speedy, chic autos that can compare to Mustang convertibles when it comes to price. I'm glad I have it and am seriously considering buying a GT in the future. Ford please don't change the body style. I'd like to see the interior improved, but most people who are aware of Mustang realize that cheap interior is par for the course. Besides, that would increase the price. Some small mishaps occurred in year 1: the windows malfunctioned at times, the trunk light went loose, the turn signal had problems. Driving out to the beach is a blast. Better than a Sebring or Solara! </TEXT>

<TEXT>We mulled it over for a while, to buy or not to buy just for a sometime driver. So I bought first Ford in many years (1990 was last). Loved the body style so bought just for body style, not as a daily driver. It has become my daily driver, parking my 02 V8 Tundra. Just made a 600 mile trip and averaged 30 MPG hwy at 70 MPH. Impressed with V6 power. It is plenty for me. Comfort is not great, cabin is not quite (primarily engine noise), but it is what it is, not a luxury car, not a speed burner, but good dependable transportation with style. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had Japanese or German cars, but the Mustang has always stirred my interest a little, despite my general disdain for American design.That is, until this new body style came along. I must admit that I warmed up to it quickly and before long, I just had to have it. I wanted a convertible (actually did not mind a V6) and realized that since I'm a family man now, there are not a lot of choices out there:(Solara, anyone? Or worse, Eos) The Mustang fit the bill: Classic style, history, raw power and seats 4 to boot. Got the V8, who needs the radio when you have the rumble from the exhaust for entertainment? Crazy torque, handles well for its size and looks gorgeous with the top down</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior style, Interior style (not materials), minimal shake for a vert, Awesome stereo (you can hear the songs at 85 mph with the wind rushing over your head), Passing prowess and drama with the manual. Surprisingly docile for city driving, corners well for a big car. Different colors on dash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After owning 7 previous stangs I am so disappointed in my 2007 V6 5 speed stang. Though the exterior of it gets my heart singing and remembering the great ones I previously owned, The clutch and transmission has been a real horror. The car emits a low growl on acceleration in the mid to back. The shifting is very rough and very hard to move into reverse. The starter failed, the door handles had to be replaced. The interior seats are cheap and the seat belt is hard to get ahold of. I've complained about the 10mph gas mileage, had been on the phone and my car at the shop for the last 3 payments. They say nothing is wrong with it. I am not used of hearing the shifting so rough and loud. Sad day</TEXT>

<TEXT>Initially I was worried about fuel mileage but anyone wanting one should not be concerned. My mixed driving has returned anywhere from 19.8 MPG to 22.0 MPG and I did a highway test to see what I would get there and it turned out 26.7 MPG running 70- 75 MPH! The engine is fantastic, revs smooth, revs fast, tremendous torque will pull from anywhere in the rev range, can run down almost anything on the road. Interior is roomy and trunk is very usuable. Has tremendous ability to handle curves and also turns tighter than my '04 did. Looks superb, I get positive comments often.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The funny thing about the V8 GT is that it gets surprisingly good MPG on the highway and I routinely get 28mpg going back and forth between New York City and Lake George (250 mi). Around town and stomping on the gas from green lights I hover around 20. My Civic got 32mpg highway. One goes 0 to 60 in 9 seconds, one gets there in about 5. The biggest chuckle I get is when I stop the car at home, reach into the back seat where my son's child seat resides and pull him out, much to the amazement of passerbys and even more when I pull out his stroller from the trunk. This is a big, wide, safe feeling car and gas attendents routinely are amazed when they can't reach across with the squeegee. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Basically you can be in like almost any gear and step on the gas and roar away. Low RPM it's growl tends turns people's heads, high RPM you approach SuperBike/NASCAR types sounds.

<TEXT>I've always wanted a convertible, now I have one. The car is fun to drive, very comfortable for a sports car, and I am really suprised at how great the ride is. I expected more road noise with the top up, so I am pleasantly surprised at the lack of noise. You can carry on a conversation with a passenger in normal tones with the top down. Same goes for listening to the radio. The V6 has plenty of power for an old guy like me (late 40's) and is pretty quick also.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Your a little late for your appointment and you must change freeways..entering the inside lane and then must crossover four lanes to make the first exit 3/4 mile on the right (the exit you hate). As you come down entrance in 3rd gear there are three trucks abreast in the right lanes. A white Camry is ahead of you with a gnarly mess of traffic behind the trucks.. but a break ahead of them. The Camry immediately moves to the freeway leaving you the rest of the entrance ramp.. You nail it quickly openning up 4-5 car lengths before you move over and hit 4th. Catching the break in traffic, you slide over the remaining lanes easily making the exit. That's when you know why you bought it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The fun factor of driving this car is off the charts! The engine, with the cold air intake, is the sweetest sounding engine that you have ever heard with a low, high pitched whistle. Get the seat warmer option and you can drive it with the top down over 40 degrees. I picked it up in Tampa and the 8 hours I spent driving it home was as much fun as a man can have with his clothes on! Handling is superb and the front seats are extremely comfortable with the ability to actually lean your head back on the head rest to prevent fatigue. Very pleased and happy with the purchase a month into the ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As a previous Mustang owner on every major model year I just had to purchase one of these. My 07 Stang is very much a V8 sitting in a V6 engine with more tourque and HP than my other GT models in the past. The interior is sporty but very cheap. The seatbelts are out of reach and non adjustable but work fine. The rear leg room is barely enough for my 8 year old, but she loves the rumble and car. Performance wise I feel that Ford should have installed better air flow technology to increase mpg and hp. The rear exhaust really needs to be dual for the pony to breathe better. I did these upgrades and I get 22 mpg city and 28 mpg hwy and run at 245 HP and 250 torque. All in a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car new and sold it after 4 months. Highs------Great looks and fun to drive Lows-----6 cyclinder 4.0 engine is loud and sounds course and unrefined. You almost think that something is wrong with the engine. Dash board rattled after the first week; however I did not take it back thinking it would get worse during the warranty period and be easier to find. 5 Speed manual transmission felt clunky, had a long throw, and seemed hard to get into gear sometimes. Seats looked good but felt like cheap material and I will be suprised if they wear well. Neutral----almost no backseat--but I knew that when I bought it. </TEXT>

Pulls good from 0 to 3000 rpm and then the power band kicks in from 3000 to redline and when it shifts into 2nd it really sinks you back into your seat.

I have had 2 warrenty issues with this Mustang. The leather insert on the pass. door had to be replaced, it was not glued on properly.

<TEXT>Being a Euro car snob I was more than surprised with how much I liked my wife's midlife crisis car. The new Mustangs have everything I always liked about American cars and none of the problems. The convertible is quiet, dry, easy to use, and little buffeting compared to other convertibles. The car handles extremely well, it is very controllable/predictable on the track and well balanced. The power is amazing, but what would I know I used to drive a Fiat. By far the biggest surprise with this car is how comfortable the car is on long trips. I can drive 800 miles and feel great when I get out. So far, I get 18.7 mpg overall which is okay considering the power and automatic transmission.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power,comfort, and handling. The Mustang has very neutral handling at the limit, not the understeering pigs that the original's were.Also, the 4.6 GT accelerates faster than the old Shelby GT 500 with the 428!

You can push this car to 80 before going into 5th. But I wouldn't recommended all the time it is only .8 seconds slower from 0 to 60 than the GT! The 07 and 08 models are identical, except miner changes. Go buy it if you love Mustangs, I will probably keep this car forever. I got the 17" wheels which is plus, but not necessary.

As a teenager, I came close to buying a family friend's 1964-1/2 Mustang, but it never happened. Even though I had a 1986 Corvette for a few years, owning a Mustang was something I always wanted to do. Now, at age 54, I've gone and done it... and, so far, it's been one heck of a fun ride! Good gas mileage, more power than I'll ever use, and a thousand different dress-ups and accessories out there on eBay, just for the Mustang! The possibilities seem endless.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving a 2001 GT convertible for a few years and fell in love with the new model once I saw the design, however, the design is only the tip of the iceberg. This is a much better car than the SN95 version, it's faster, the transmission doesn't feel like a pickup's, my girlfriend can push down the clutch, and it's no longer a rattlebox. The car keeps pulling through 4th gear, and doesn't feel like you're inside of a B-17's nacelle over Germany like the old one did. This is a very comfortable car and no longer feels like the boy racer my 2001 was. That was a very solid car, but the new model is in a new class, it's a grown-up's car that makes you feel like you're 16.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am totally pleased and surprised by my new 2007 Mustang V6 coupe! For a V6, this car has a nice throaty sound, and the power is better than I expected with a V6. It easily attains (and uhhh...surpasses) freeway speeds. It handles very well too -- I love to take fast curves and so does this car. I am a large gal, so obviously I questioned whether or not this car would be spacious enough. I am pleased to report that not only is there enough room for me in the driver's seat but there is also sufficient room for my equally large daughter to sit in the back seat. In short, I highly recommend the 2007 V6 Mustang.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is not much that I can about this car that is not positive. I only have one complaint. The mp3 player jack being inside the console. I have to slip the cord out of the console to put my player in the cup holder and the cord gets cut sometimes. Other than that, this car is everything I ever dreamed about as a kid when my Dad promised to get me my first Mustang only to come home with a new truck for himself. The drive and handling is amazing. The interior is roomy and comfortable. Shifting is smooth. Pick up is amazing for a 6. Nice throaty sound. A real eye catcher. Everyone compliments my car, even the cop who gave me my last ticket. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Old school looks, throaty sound, great pick up, comfortable interior. Ability to change the dash light colors. Great sounding stereo. Basically, the whole car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I first saw a Ford Mustang when I was 16 in 1964 at the Bowen Scharff Ford dealership. Now at 59 and the new retro style of the Mustang I finally bought one. I really like how it looks and sounds. I was torn between the convertible and coupe, but in Washington, we get a lot of rain. I immediatley loaded the CD player with 60's music. My wife and I really enjoy driving this car and plan on getting a vanity license plate, first time we have ever done something like that. It is great! 16 again in Bonney Lake</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style and V8 engine and sound.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased a 2002 Mustang GT for the wife and wound up driving it myself as our family grew. Just replaced the 2002 at 96K miles with only changing tires, oil.. etc. New Mustang goes beyond the '02 quality. Styling is excellent, and you can tell the engineers put a lot of time into this vehicle. Expecting to have the same success with the '07 as with the '02</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exhaust note and cabin sound are 100% improved. You only hear want you want to hear. The external styling is great. Ford has also taken a step by offering so many varieties of the car (California pkg.. 18" wheels.. etc). Really feel like yours is special</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got 150000 miles on my 96 Mustang. Finally got new one month ago, my wife wanted orange convert. but i talked her into alloy hardtop. The top is one of my favorite things about it. The back looks like 70, the windshield is flat sleek. I want to keep it all stock except for cold air intake. Pony package a must on V6, biggest rims ever on V6 mustang! It feels solid. I had very good luck with my 96, I plan on driving it to 200000. My wife plans on storing it for the winter. If it's as good as my other one I'll be happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is way better than 96! I like the stealth look of alloy. 5 speed auto is great! 60 more horses than 96! Almost as good on gas. Loaded, pony pkg., side air bags, traction control, leather, alarm, mach500.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car! I get looks and comments everywhere from total strangers and they all love the design and performance. Vista blue is an awesome color with the white stripe. Fit and finish is great. I test drove a Solstice, Pontiac G6, and a Mitsubishi Spyder convertible. This car blows them all away and is cheaper to boot. It also has a trunk that's pretty darn large and a back seat that is adequate. I am getting between 21 and 25 mpg and have plenty of power.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Awesome looking vehicle better than all past Mustangs. Total strangers always admiring design! Great stereo and great looking wheels. Very comfortable interior with plenty of room. V-6 gets very nice gas mileage between 21 and 25 mpg. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>High performance, better than average fuel economy. Still a tight package on the interior, needs a little more shoulder and hip room. Handling is very good. Plenty of power on tap when you need it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow, what an excellent car. I have owned nothing but Dodges in the past, this is my first Ford product ever. The acceleration is great. This car has no rattles, and feels tight, not wet noodle sloppy like some brands do when the road turns from smooth to choppy. I special ordered the GT deluxe, and added the leather seats upgrade which saved me about $600 over the GT premium version. the stock 4 speaker stereo CD player in the GT deluxe is more than enough for me. I felt the shaker 500 stereo standard in the GT premium wasnt worth the extra money. You can buy one off the lot, or special order mix n match options or colors to your liking. plus there's many aftermarket parts to make it your own.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the 1967/1968 fastback styled exterior and interior. The mycolor gauge backlighting and old school styled dash. There is a ready aftermarket to customize it or hot rod it to your liking. I have already started to make mine look like a 1967 shelby GT 350. I love all the attention mine gets. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased a new 2007 Mustang for my son. We opted for the V-6 Pony because the insurance for a 16-year-old was more than the monthly payment on the car. The car is beautiful. Fit and finish are perfect. So far we have had no problems. Power is OK and fuel economy is very good. Ride is surprisingly compliant, yet firm. No body roll. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Retro looks remind me of my 1966 Mustang. Interior looks like a 1968 Mustang. Seats are comfortable, especially the driver's power seat. Smooth automatic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car as a toy, since it is my second driver. Overall I am pleased with the vehicle but not overwhelmed by it. However, I am a performance junky so now stock car is ever good enough. For the money I feel that it is one of the best, sports car buys out there. But with cheap price some sacrifices must me made. I feel the interior could stand to have some increased quality parts and the back seat needs to be a bit larger. Average MPG is good for a V8 at about 22 MPG, in mixed driving. My last toy was a Mitsu EVO 8. As far as looks the Mustang wins hands down, but in the performance dept. the EVO dominates.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When my BMW Z3 M Coupe was destroyed in a fire, I decided to go with the Mustang because the insurance money almost covered the entire cost. My last Mustang was a '91 and obviously, the 2007 is vastly better. The ride is comfortable and fun and the engine delivers. Dont go expecting true sports-car performance though. The Stang drives like an American car, despite Ford's best efforts. Engine response remains slightly sluggish and handling is a bit wobbly. That said, you wont find better performance or looks for a comparable price anywhere, so some compromise is in order.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It looks amazing. And with the optional Shaker 1000, it also sounds brilliant. And again, value for money is unbeatable, especially in the EU, where the Stang costs less than a European car with half the power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Less than 1000 miles, but I'm impressed. Wanted a fun to drive car and for less than 27K very happy. Have the big wheels and a few more options including the interior upgrade package. Deffinitely handles and feels more like a muscle car than sports car. Tough choice between 2.9 financing and cash back incentives. Suprised at how smooth the ride is. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a 2007 Mustang V6, which is my first new car and a serious step up from my old beater. I absolutely love the way it looks and it's a blast to drive. The interior looks great and is very comfortable, with only 2 exceptions. Having a manual tranny, I find the cupholders are not very good, and the car really need an overhead handle on the passenger side. Other than that the car is great. It's fun to drive, looks great and is still resonably roomy for a sports car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great exterior looks, awesome dash set up, even the V6 sounds great, and very comfortable to shift and drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my GT 6 months ago and have already put 10,000 miles on it. It's a very fun and surprisingly comfortable daily driver. It looks good, goes very fast, sounds great, and can cruise on the highway "sipping" gas too. It's still in great shape, minus a few scratches from being driven thru the winter and it's an overall great car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style and power. The two main reasons why anyone gets a Mustang. I also like how comfortable it is when cruising and how it turns into a total beast when provoked.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When they stopped making the Trans Ams in 2002 I never thought I'd get the sport convertible I always wanted. Then the new body style Mustangs came out in '05 and I secretly craved one for my driveway. After biting the bullet and admitting that I loved this Ford despite it being a Ford, I've got one. It is an amazing ride, and there is nothing like the feel of the wind blowing through your hair at 80 MPH on the interstate. Watch out though! It's very easy to just keep right on accelerating and never even notice. I had it up to 100 and it felt just as smooth and sturdy as at 65. Overall, the Mustang is a good buy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stereo system, although it does cause the side mirrors to vibrate so bad you can't see. The ease of the convertible top. The sound when I rev it in the driveway. </FAVORITE>
