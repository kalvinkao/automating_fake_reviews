<TEXT>Purchased a 2007 LS460L last week with 13,000 miles. Bought it online from out of town dealer. My first Lexus. Beautiful in most all aspects except for noticeable wind noise at highway speeds. For a car company with Lexus' reputation, I found this disturbing. The local dealership was very aware of the problem, replaced both front windows and "reseated" the rear view mirrors. Now I hear wind noise only when I drive at 100+ mph. Seriously. (Yes, I know I shouldn't drive that fast, but how do you otherwise pass someone who's only doing 85?) In any event, the problem was solved, I am very pleased and cannot keep the smile off my face when behind the wheel of this luxurious beauty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Electronics and ergonomics. Controls make sense and are intuitive. The extra legroom in the back of the "L" makes people feel like they are being chauffered.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned 5 Lexus. 1st was 1990. The best was last model of the 430. The new model has the following flaws, 1) Seat comfort is not the same as previous. 2) The rear view window is not large enough an one suffers from not having the same visibility as previous models. 3) The trunk is smaller due to the larger indented wheel wells that result in loss of space. 4) The design doesn't say, distinctive or luxury... instead it says, "this is a pregnant Camry."</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the electronics. Sometimes I call it my "Sony-mobile". Lots of great features. But, a little hard to program the features that are easy to use, however. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a good reliable car with some nice bells and whistles but I would never call it a Premier Luxury car. It is one of the noisest cars I have ever owned and with its price tag and rave reviews about how quiet the car is I expected a lot more. The wind noise is terrible. It sounds like the window is cracked when driving at 55 or greater. Lexus insulated the roof posts and replaced side windows with insulated glass but it helped very little. Very annoying and it makes me cringe when I think about what I paid for it. Also an annoying rattle the dealer is trying to correct with little luck so far. Also very expensive to maintain. $200.00 for an oil change and tire rotation. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radar cruise control is best feature if you do a lot of highway driving. Hold feature that keeps you from drifting back on hill is nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my fifth Lexus LS. I enjoyed my 2001 LS 430 more than this one based on what appears to be an unresolvable wind noise. The car had the "fix" and although the noise is not as harsh, it is still very noticeable in certain wind conditions or speeds. Also notice what I would call a ticking from the engine at idle and was told that it is normal for this car. My 2001 was much quieter and more comfortable as I also find the front seats to be less than perfect as it applies to being comfortable. Still would consider owning another Lexus but intend to see what Lexus does about truly fixing this problem. Not happy about spending this kind of money and still hearing wind noise. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The wind noise is still very excessive on the passenger side after Lexus installed the fix for the issue (November 2007). 10 out of 10 passengers in my car thinks the windows are not closed tightly. The wind noise is not acceptable to me for such an expensive car. This car is supposed to be quiet. Lexus still claims that. My experience with this car and Lexus customer service has been big dissapointment to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven Mercedes, BMW, and Audi for forty years, and this is my first Japanese vehicle. I love it! It's fast, smooth, quiet, and unexciting. Perfect for lawn bowling and AARP meetings. Mushy suspension and unresponsive steering, unlike the German cars. Minimum service, unlike the German cars. Windshild wipers which work properly. Heating and cooling which work properly. Multiple electronics which all work properly. I love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd LS. My 1991 LS 400 lasted 16 years/350K miles. My 460L Exec Class has 4 seats, including the recliner with ottoman and massage. It also came with the nav system, Mark Levinson sound, DVD drop down screen. My brother-in-law was in the recliner watching a movie through the wireless headset and getting a Shiatsu massage, said I needed to have a chauffeur's hat. Many more electronic controls than my old LS, but they are laid out in a simple way and pretty intuitive, though reading the encyclopedic manual is very useful. Wind noise issue seems solved for the later built cars (mine was built in 7/07), but test drive the car you are buying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased car in September 2007. Test drove BMW 750i and decided to buy LS 460 due to reliability track record. The car is a great improvement over LS 430 in most categories. The interior design is more sporty and not just for older crowd. Exterior design is sporty but blends in with smaller Lexus sedans too easily. The seats are not very supportive in hard turns but comfortable. Rear seats with power recline and ventilation are very comfortable. The suspension is far better then previous LS 430. One major flaw is wind noise from both front windows. Just like every one else waiting for dealer to get parts as per Lexus bulletin. I seriously hope that this will fix the noise issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car. Fantastic integration of electronics with touch screen navigation screen. Much more user freindly then previous LS 430. Great sound system but it you crank up the volume at low base the rear windo glass starts vibrating. One big problem is the wind noise at highway cruising speed (LS 430 was superior in sound isolation). Front seats not as comfortable as LS 430. Took away the motorized air vents, not so happy about that. Ride is more sporty and transmission is flawless. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Although I would like to own an American car, I had to give up my Cadillac for this one. Originally looked at the 430 in 2006. Glad I waited for the 460. After much research, I think I made the best choice. Was recently advised that there is a service bulletin for interior wind noise. Dealer, once approved after tech ride along, will replace weatherstrip, install thicker glass and additional insulation. My parts are on order. Hope the fix works.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle, but with one real problem and a few minor problems. A couple of months after owning the car both my wife and I started to notice that the front seats were becoming less comfortable. It feels like there is a bar across the back of the seat and down the middle. There's no way I could drive the car for some hours. My Lexus dealer says this is normal stretching. Very limited access to the navigation system while moving is a pain. There is an annoying tick from the engine compartment at idle which the dealer says is normal. Wind noise is present at above 45 MPH. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation system is great, provided you only want to use it while stopped. Audio system is the best I've ever heard - in a house or a car. The internal design is luxurious. Acceleration is great, cornering less so.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the perfect car! Beautifully styled, luxuriously outfitted, strong performance, and incredible finish and reliability. I have owned 10 Lexuses, including the previous generation LS 430, but this one is the pinnacle of perfection. The worries and stress drain from me when I sit behind the wheel, glance at the elegant wood trim, tune the Mark Levinson stereo, and sink into the cushioned leather of the most comfortable driver's seat in autodom. The interior is whisper quiet, with a faint engine noise as the car effortlessly accelerates to freeway speed. I am in heaven.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned the car for a month and a half now, and the Lexus lockout of much of the navigation, phone, and even audio functions while the car is in motion is a major issue - had Lexus been honest and forthright about this in their sales literature and through their dealership, I would have not purchased the vehicle. Overall, the car rides nice, but a bit insulated. My previous car, a 2006 750li, handles better, provides better tactile road feel, has far more comfortable and adjustable seats, and, with its active suspensions, corners mush better than the LS. I do like the exterior styling of the LS better</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle based upon build quality, style and value. I should have paid more attention to comfort and convenience. Both front seats are uncomfortable due to a support in the center of seat bottom which I did not notice during my test drive. As I drive 35,000 miles a year new destinations are common place. The guidance system limits programming to voice commands once the vehicle is in motion though the system can be programmed via voice instruction this to limit distraction to the driver. However, the voice recognition system leaves much to be desired. The reality is there are enough selections on the display screen to make this idea laughable. Let the driver drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>A luxurious/top quality driving machine that surpasses Mercedes and BMW easily. I had a 2006 S500, and 2007 S550. They don't compare in quality to this car and the Lexus costs less! All the special features spoil you: easy to use navigation, park assist, superb ride, quietness inside, ability to change driving mode to either Normal/Comfort/Sport. Wow, that makes it so fun. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I have read about Lexus for years, but I finally tried one and I am pleased to tell you, all those good things you read and hear are true.

<TEXT>This is my third LS (previously had 1990 and 1998 models). I'm on the fence with this one. On the one hand I love the vehicle's safety features, the interior, the gadgets and the acceleration. On the other hand the vehicle came with several problems - wind noise, hesitation at start, wing mirrors that did not unfold when they should, and locks that did not automatically lock when they should. All these issues have been resolved, but they left me concerned. There's too much road noise - the tires need to be upgraded to Michelin SP2 or equivalent. The engine sounds a little rough when accelerating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are a Lexus family with currently an LX and a GS. We were ready to add a large sedan and spent an ample amount of time driving the BMW 745LI, Mercedes S550 and of course the LS 460L. Although the S550 is an extremely nice auto, I'm very pleased to have saved $15k-$20k and stayed with Lexus. This is by far the nicest automobile I have been in and is an absolute pleasure to drive. I thought the LX wouldn't never be replaced as my favorite auto, but neither it nor the GS has been out of the garage since the LS came home. Forget about the negative auto park reviews, that's not why you buy this Lexus. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove my LS 460L on two long trips, one 1,200 miles, the other 4,300 miles. The car was flawless. Using radar cruise, MPG was as high as 30.1 and no lower than 26.7 in a very strong headwind. With a 22.2 gallon tank, the range is terrific and after driving long stretches there was very little driver fatigue. This is my fourth Lexus and the only car of the four that was perfect right off the lot. Having recently owned competitor?s cars, I think this is the very best value on the market today. I drove the LS 460L, Mercedes 550, and BMW 750 back to back. When driving each car I couldn?t find enough of a driver experiene difference so my decision came down to features and the Lexus won.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Once again Lexus exceeds the offerings from German manufacturers. After the numerous problems I have had with German cars it is comforting to have a car which is so smooth, well built and reliable. It would have been nice if the exterior design was a little more exciting, but I suppose at this level, cars need to be more sophisticated than fashionable. I wish I had spent more time with the dealer at the time of purchase so he could talk me through the numerous features. He did offer to demonstrate everything but I thought I would work it all out myself - wrong! The instruction book is a little complicated to follow, with so many features and variations within the model range.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I guess it is needless to mention all the technological marvels that have been included in this vehicle. The 380 HP power plant paired with an 8 speed automatic transmission deliver the most pleasant, luxury ride. The car comes pre-packaged in 4-5 trims. Unfortunately I could not get a laser-guided cruise control with pre-collision system, since it is only offered on the top of the line LS460 L. I could not buy the longer version due to length limitation of my garage, and the above feature is not normally installed on lower end models. Of course one could configure any combination of features, but that is subject for a long wait, since vehicle has to be special ordered in this case. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from a BMW and I liked the styling and competitive pricing in this LS 460 luxury auto. After two visits to the dealership, they have no answer for the very annoying whistling coming from the driver's side rear view mirror when reaching speeds over 40 mph. Had to do my own detective work - seemed to be coming from the driver's window, but after some painstaking effort on my part, I narrowed it down to the mirror housing. Have to turn up the radio to drown out the intolerable whistling noise. Only time it stops is when it rains. Only disappointing problem. Other than that, a great luxury car that gets constant compliments from admirers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned BMW, have a Mercedes in the garage for the wife and this is definitely the best built car I have ever driven. I bought the 460 short wheel base. Zero to 60 in 5.4-5.6 seconds is not too shabby compared to the BMW 7 and Benz S class. Interior ergonomics and technology is not even close, the Lexus is superior. The 460 SWB compared to the BMW 750i seems to have more rear seat leg room and the 460L seemed like a waste of money. The BMW may own the market for road feel, but its not enough to justify the extra $16k. I was a bmw bigot, but the 460 is definitely the king of the class. Gas mileage compared to the others is superior as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It would be more helpful if posters identify their specific model; my take is there is a noticeable difference between SWB, LWB, and the Touring Package. I am very apprehensive at the moment re reliability; I had a rather simple electrical problem which seemed to baffle service personnel. The Parking Assist accessory borders on fraud by Lexus as it relates to the owner; it is complicated, flakey, and poorly supported with useful instructional material. All 460L models I have seen have this option, and when even my dealership couldn't get it to work reliably, they advised "just don't use it."</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned S500s, 7-series, A8s, and an LS 430. After my latest car ('04 S500), I decided to give Lexus another try with their new LS 460L. After owning the car for a few months now, I've come to realize why it is so much cheaper than its claimed competition (S550, A8L, 750Li.) The performance, attention to detail, driving technology advancement, luxury, and style is sub par when compared with the German makes. After switching between my wife's 745Li and this car, I definitely notice the small touches with the BMW that add up to huge diff. (i.e., driver oriented controls, smoother/wider power band, brakes that automatically dry themselves, power closing drs, etc.).</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned 5 Lexus cars and the LS 460 is the best in a grouping of cars that were all outstanding. The attention to detail, the comfort and style, inside and out, are exceptional. We have been approached several times by people wanting to look at the car and to congratulate us on having such a beautiful automobile. Dollar for dollar, there is no other luxury car in its class that comes close to the Lexus LS 460.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 6th Lexus automobile and BY FAR the nicest and best riding I have ever had! I own 4 cars including a Mercedes, but this car has them all beat by a mile or two! It is very quiet and smooth with lots of power and I love all the little goodies it has such as showing me the tire pressures, even for the spare, by pushing a button! The GPS is MUCH improved and the ride is just wonderful!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite features??? Well there is not one thing I do not LOVE on this car. It has everything one could ever want in an automobile!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Front interior room seems wider and higher. Vehicle is faster and more responsive than the LS 430. Leather work is craftsman style as in the SC 430. Enjoying the satellite radio. Strong climate control. No wind noise. The engine is now audible at idle. 8 forward gears. Came with Bridgestones not Dunlops: runs straight down the road - no wandering drift. Stronger brakes than the LS 430 . Easier steering. Larger view from backup camera . This car is a 10. Nothing negative!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The LS 460L sets new standards for the luxury car market. Mine replaces a European luxury car and is a huge improvement over my previous model. The panel is attractive and the controls are logical. Comfort for a king. Never have I seen such luxury. Room, room - the front seats move back far enough to accommodate the very largest drivers. Astonishing rear space for long legs. The car has superb handling and firm cornering. Quick as a cat, it handles tight, rough mountain roads effortlessly. Acceleration is astonishing for this huge sedan. Braking is equally smooth and quick. The LS 460L is a Winner!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my LS 430 for an LS 460 this last month. The 460 is comparable in interior size and leg room although the trunk is a tad smaller. The car rides well and is a bit more noisy than the 430. The electronics (radio, DVD, GPS) are great but complicated and require a bit of concentration to use.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy interior. Clear display and controls. Plenty of power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really enjoy and like the car overall. I feel foolish purchasing the executive package, as you have to be less than 5 ft tall to recline in the back seat recliner. When it is reclined, the front rider seat inhibits the window view out the right side of the car and no one can ride in the front right seat. It goes from a 4 seater to a 3 seater.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Voice control is much improved over my old 430 LS. The car feels like luxury. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have tested S550, BMW 7 series and Audi A-8. Lexus has the best engine, drive train, interior quality, options and dollar value. Put the Lexus dependability on top of all these, I cannot see how people can justify the other German products.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The history of Lexus is unquestionably the best in category for reliability, workmanship, innovation, comfort and value. This vehicle leads the pack of all vehicles made by Toyota. Of course, reliability is yet to be seen but if I were a betting man I would bet the farm on this car as well. I've had the car only 2 weeks and can't find enough excuses to tell my wife why I need to leave the house and go out just so I can drive our new baby. The joy of leaving the garage and driving countless miles in any direction is what I live for these days. I never thought I would want to go to work in the morning.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound system!! You forget that you're in a car. XM radio limits your commercials so the music pipes through those 19 speakers uninterrupted and before you know it, you've reached your destination only to ask yourself like a little kid, "Can we do it again, pleassssseeee".</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second LS and it is by far the very best. The newly designed body is most striking and the interior is beautiful. The 19 speaker sound system is concert quality and the Park assist feature is truely unique. It is without a doubt the finest car I have ever driven. I can't imagine what the next generation of Lexus will bring, however, I'm already looking forward to it. As usual, Lexus has outdone itself again!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took delivery on Oct 27 after 8 months waiting. It has been worth it -- far superior in all ways except smoothness of ride to my 2000 LS 400. Comfort and ergonomics are great. The DVD navigation system is an improvement over my wife's SC 430 and the voice recognition works perfectly. The brake hold feature is a wonderful touch; I use it all the time. Comfort of the seats is great and the back seats are simply exceptional. I am always surprised at the comparisons with big MB's/BMW's where the LS is denigrated for its handling. I don't buy a 4200 pound car for handling. I am interested in comfort, quiet, seamless power, good brakes, intuitive controls and DEPENDABILITY. The LS excels !</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is amazing. It drives smooth, powerful and a kick under the hood if you need to get going. I was able to move up in the pecking order by getting the longer wheel base. I am glad I did. My kids tell me the back seats are more comfortable than the front. Unfortunately for them it may be some time before their dad drives them again. They kept playing with the rear sunshade, adjusting the seats, turning on the seat heaters on each other. I finally just turned up the awesome sound system to drown out the fighting in the back. I'm a little over 6'6". I can fit comfortably behind the fully extended drivers seat. I have spent the last 2 days uploading CDs into the hard drive in the stereo. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style of the car, the drive is amazing, power of the engine, the stereo and the interior. The leather seats are very comfortable. Most of the toys that are in the car can be operated without reading the directions. But I guess the salesman did link up the cell for me. I also like the keyless entry. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have read the magazines review for this car, but they get a little picky in my view, If it does a quarter mile in 5.6 or 5.4 seconds, this car is quick!! It really responds on the highway, like when you are going 80 mph and you give it a little gas and you are going 100 mph in an instant. This car is fun to drive, it is a luxury sports car. I test drove the Benz and the BMW, I don't know what the magazines are talking about, they do not hold a candle to this car, especially in value. Drive one for you yourself, you will see!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stereo, blue tooth, the nav system is one of the best I have ever used, all touch screen and voice activated, plus it is not a CD system. The engine is awesome, the keyless features. The seating positions are flawless, this car is the best value on the market. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got the car yesterday, it?s awesome, extremely comfortable front and back seats, pleasure to drive. Finally Lexus can claim to compete with BMW 7 series and with S550. Navigation is easy to use, touch base navigation & phone use is superb and makes driving easier. Voice based commands is still an issue, requires more practice. The drive is more smooth and silent as c/w S550. Center console is easy to use. While reversing the camera is a big help.on the whole its been worth the wait.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Park assist, blue tooth based phone. Rear seat passenger room and rear seat climate control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I play for a professional sports team in Denver and got my hands on a new LS 460 this month. I have really enjoyed the features and the comfortable interior of this car. It is very roomy and comfortable. It has a smooth and responsive powertrain. It is very comfortable and the hands free parking feature is very cool. I've been getting some looks in it... it is definitely a head turner and looks great on 20s.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is so much superior to the LS 400 or 430 in style and features, and has much more get up and go. I love the handling and the brake hold is an innovation that I would not of imagined. I use it all the time. Very easy to program the car, even tho there are so many electronic marvels to use.</TEXT>
