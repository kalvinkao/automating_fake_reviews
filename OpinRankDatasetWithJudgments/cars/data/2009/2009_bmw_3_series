<TEXT>If you're a 'driver' you'll love the steering, suspension and handling. Plus, the car is tight, engine is smooth and interior is perfect. But... HD radio is terrible. Constantly flips in & out of HD, save your money. BMW won't fix it. Auto trans is also sketchy. In sport mode it won't ever go to 6th gear and regular mode just doesn't downshift readily. If you're doing 40 MPH and step on it, it bogs down unless you press deep on the pedal. It makes the car feel underpowered. But you can punch it down a gear (or 2) with paddle shifters (I have sport pkg). Had a 330i with 5-spd prior to this and power wise, this is a little disappointing. If you're on the fence... get the Turbo! Wish I did.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sport package seats and heaters (they're fast). Chunky steering wheel. Exterior style. Back seat is most usable in this class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never pictured myself as a BMW type person. Had mostly driven domestics and "base model" imports (Honda, Toyota). I absolutely love this car. Fit and finish is great. Engine is smooth and fast with great mid-range torque. A little lag at initial acceleration (x Drive related) but it was an easy thing to adjust to. Nav works great; i Drive system took a little getting used to but is user friendly once you master it. Haven't driven through a winter yet so can't comment on the AWD. Far and away the best car I've ever owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall ride quality, engine performance, very responsive feel behind the wheel. Beautiful exterior; great fit and finish.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I don't regret buying this car for one second! It is incredibly fun to drive, looks great, and performs like a BMW should. It sticks to the road like glue and makes even the most boring commute bearable with it's performance and style. I have had no problems with this car so far and it has not required any return trips to the dealer. I was going to get the 328 initially, but after driving the 335 I knew I wouldn't be as happy as I am now with the extra HP afforded by the 335.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Automatic transmission with DS mode. DS mode makes an automatic great... went in wanted a manual transmission but after driving the automatic I was converted. Comfort Access - worth it. Push button start - love it. Seats and all the adjustments are great! Interior styling is perfect.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'd strongly considered the new 335d sedan earlier this summer, but opted for the 335i sedan instead...primarily due to availability and price considerations. This is my 6th BMW in the last 20 years, and I'm in love all over again with my car!! The sport package is worth the price, and the new IDRIVE nav system is much improved over the 2006 model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In US Army, and drove an 18 year old Bimmer for 2 yrs in Germany. Loved it so much and impressed I bought a new one. My first sports car! Got the jet black stock color. It hugs the road like nothing I've ever driven. Goes effortlessly to 110mph, and it's great to be able to do this on the autobahn and still be legal! Fits my 3 kids, 11, 9, and 6 in the back seat, though it's tight. Trunk bigger than expected. I too have had trouble shifting smoothly with the "drive by wire" clutch it has. At first I thought it was me, but looking at other reviews I guess it's just the technology. Too bad it can't keep you from stalling it too. Overall we love our Bimmer!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Jet black color is awesome clean and shined! WOW! Love the body contouring, it just looks lean and mean. Love the cruise controls, easy to use. Auto wipers rock, even shut off in the down position if car is turned off early. Very SOLID built interior. It is built to last, like my 18 yr old BMW.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have just completed my first 3 months of owning a BMW. The performance of the car on the road is as advertised. Stupidly fast!! Steering a little tight in the parking lot, but exceptional as you get going. I absolutely love the sound of the twin turbo charged engine, and the effortless ease at which the car accelerates. My only major gripe with the car is the interior. Whilst the quality of the material is ok, it's way too plain and dull for a $50,000 sports sedan. I think it is the worst interior off all the cars competing in this segment. The interior of the Audi, Benz, Lexus, and Cadillac is a lot better. BMW, take note!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first BMW convertible and it is a blast. The German engineering is without question. The folding convertible top is an engineering marvel. Takes 23 seconds to fold into the trunk. I was happy to see that I still had room in the trunk to store some small things after the top had been stored in this area. Excellent pick up and the interior workmanship is top notch. This is quite the head turner and when you put the top down, you will draw an audience. Fantastic car and fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Convertible top, interior styling and outside finish. Drives great and is quite the head turner. Bluetooth and XM radio are the bomb. Sport package and premium package finish it out nicely. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First time BMW owner and just got my 335D. Everything I hoped for came true. The look and feel of a world class car with the mileage of an economy car. The power is outstanding and the ride is so effortless that you can't tell how fast you are going. One issue is the cupholders...seems like with all the engineering prowess of BMW a suitable solution could be put in place.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Aside from the reviews of people that went to a sedan after owning an SUV, or those who never owned a classy yet sporty vehicle (same as SUVs?) no offense meant, but this iteration of the 3 series is missing the "Ultimate Driving Machine" feel of old. The engine is wonderful, however, driving feel is almost numb, and the drive by wire, in addition to the AWD makes for some very sloppy and awkward shifting also mentioned in Edmund's review. The interior appears to be a throwback from Buick, and the exterior is very Hyundai, with the raised panels on the sides and large flat area around the wheel wells. I'm in a 3 yr lease, but I'll opt for a G37x next time!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Needed a simple not too flashy business/ personal car and drove everything in this class. G8 was fun but future is bad. Jetta was okay but not as refined. Audi too slow. Owned a 99 328i so I decided to try 328i and not 330i as this is business car. Wow, this is a performance car with luxury and brings smiles every time I drive. Hard to do when you are replacing a Vette. Driving dynamics are still the best after all these years. BMW Straight 6 is still the best engine made on the planet. I was surprised the buying experience, price and attitude of BMW has changed. Got best deal from them which was a total surprise.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, comfort of driving position, and the way it handles all type of roads and driving situations. New wet braking is great here in Florida. Auto is very responsive in manual mode when you want to race.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first BMW. Thought I wanted to own one to see how I liked being a Bimmer owner. It's a nice ride but is TOO expensive for what you get. Not much value for the money. I also hear the whining noise coming from the engine or transmission. Sounds like the whining sound from a turbine, but the car does not have a turbocharger. The sound varies at different speeds and engine torque. Sometimes not very noticeable at all. The seats are also hard comparable to competition. Nice build quality though. Not much luxury options for the buck though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not a BMW fan in general, but bought this after a test drive. It's no sports car, but is fun to drive. Much more importantly the refinement is peerless. Interior reviews for this car are so-so, but I personally love the mixture of simplicity and great build quality - it fits my definition of 'luxury' more than lots of buttons or extra decoration. For me, it was the refinement and composure that won me over, but the gas mileage (25mpg so far) is a bonus. Worst aspect is the attention. People think buying a BMW says something about you (either good or bad) - and either way it's totally out of proportion with reality... It's just a sedan for crying out loud!! My $40K Nissan got no attention.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-Amazing dual purpose character - total refinement at moderate throttle turns to pleasant snarl at high RPM; -Semi-auto is push-forward for downshifts - perfect! -DSC allows a little tail action, even fully engaged; -lights on exterior door handles are one of those great touches -Bluetooth</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had the the car for about 3 weeks now. Having too much fun. I never thought I'd be driving a diesel. Diesel smell gives me a headache but this car does not have it. The exhaust pipes are still so shiny even after 1250 miles of driving. Have to buy a good radar detector to help reduce the chance of getting tickets. Car goes to 50 mph too fast and without much effort. Run flat tires not much of a bother.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd BMW coupe and it is by far the best as it builds on what BMW does best - great performance without sacrificing everyday driveability and comfort. The twin turbo six delivers amazing torque throughout the rev range and the new ZF auto transmission shifts are crisp and timely - especially when in sport mode. The interior is a clean design and driver oriented with minimal electronic visual distractions. Visibility is excellent and the ride, while firm, is a good compromise between handling and comfort.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car has all the toys: premium, sport, GPS, Logic7, HD, iPOD and etc. Really scoots but it is also somewhat harsh to ride in. Could be the RFT or just the way it is designed with sport suspension. The iDrive is OK but the location is right where I rest my hand and that tends to cause phone calls and etc. 96 pages in electronics operation guide. Got the extended warranty and tire warranty. The difference between standard and Logic7 is much more than three speakers. Standard has 180 watts and Logic7 has 420 watts plus two additional front tweeters, front center speaker, higher quality speakers and surround sound. Much bigger sound.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband and I wanted to buy a fuel efficient car that was safe and fun to drive. Finally the BMW brought the diesels to the US! Once we test drove this car - we both fell for it. This car is a blast to drive and very comfortable. My husband commutes in it the most and we always take the BMW 335d on weekends. We even plan to take it on the next family road trip. Our kids (one booster, one car seat) fit fine in the back seat and we can fit two medium suitcases in the trunk, plus a few more things. Hope they offer the manual option and the Wagon in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Two problems have detracted from my enjoyment of the 2099 BMW 335xi. Car is back at the dealer for the third time for replacement of fuel injector jets. Four this time. I get up to speed on the highway, but do not have a heavy foot and haven't had the car on a race track. What's the story? Getting close to Lemon Law time! The run-flat, low-profile tires are just awful on New England roads. Never, never again. Hit anything a half-inch high or low and it sounds like the car is bottoming out. Extremely rough ride at even 40 mph. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is so much fun to drive and so expensive to maintain. It has been 8 months. Finally I hit a pot hole in New York City and had a bubble on the side. Our dealer changed the tire and charged $488 for one single tire!!! I had insurance and expected to be reimbursed. However, this is another sign that this is a premium car and it is expensive to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my new 2009 328i for 2 months now and it's been great so far. Very smooth ride, responsive handling, feel the road, and more than adequate on gas mileage. I have to watch the speedometer at all times because it drives very fast. Acceleration from full stop could be better. In hindsight I should not have purchased in Alpine White as it shows dirt easily but after each wash, it looks beautiful.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 328 i AWD sedan in May 2009. It has 1500 miles. I am extremely dissatisfied with it with the following reasons - Under the hood BMW uses many plastic protection covers that cause rattling noise on rough roads - Rattling noise inside both rear doors - Rattling noise coming from cheaply designed cup holders in the front and rear. - Rattling noise inside the armrest between two rear seats. - Major rattling noise coming from inside the dashboard. - Poor engine noise insulation. The hood surface facing the engine does not have any foaming, unlike many other cars. - Flat drive tires cause stiff road experience. - Poor speech detection. This is my second 3 series, but it will be the last.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Recently bought '09 328I coupe with Premium and Sporkts pkg. The car is outstanding in every aspect except for the Run Flat Tires (RFT) which come on the car. The tires produce so much road noise that they totally ruin the BMW experience. If you don't mind a sports/luxury car that has the road noise of a 4 wheel drive truck/suv then you will love this car. Wish I could get my '02 325CIc back. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is very comfortable (I'm 6ft 2in), feels solid and inspires confidence. I haven't driven it much @ high speeds, mainly around town. I wanted a 6sp manual, but would have had to order it from the factory, so I got auto which came with sport drive & paddle shifters, which I enjoy. I'm only getting about 15 mpg in city driving altho I usually keep transmission in reg drive. I have the sport seats which give great lateral support & are very comfortable. Only issue is with the run-flat tires; I tested the cold tire pressure & one of the front tires was @ 40 psi; mfg recommends 32 psi front, but when I let out air to get to 32 psi in the tire, I got a low pressure warning per the TPM. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first BMW. I previously owned an Infiniti G35. No comparison. I always thought the car magazines were in the tank for BMW, until I bought this car. It's my favorite car I've ever owned. The engine reminds me of a sewing machine. It it so smooth and never runs out of power. The turbo is great. I test drove a 328, which was nice, but it had no get up and go. With 22000 miles on it, my 335 still feels solid as a rock. I'm single with no kids, and the only reason I will ever get rid of this car is if my lifestyle changes and I need more room. The backseat is way better than the Infiniti (an adult can actually sit upright), but it's still a pain to get in and out. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine is great. I really like the interior. What initially got my attention was the exterior styling. I still find myself smiling when I'm walking across a parking lot toward it.

<TEXT>This is my 4th 3-series, and I should have done more research. When AC is on, the engine does not feel as smooth as it should when stopped at a red light. Driving at speeds of 40 miles per hour, you can hear high pitch sound. The run flat tires are a good idea, but makes the ride feel more stiff, tires wear out quicker than regular tires, and the tires cost about 150 dollars more per tire. Gasoline requirement is recommended 93 top tier gasoline. One interesting thing I noticed is that if their are no error codes during the diagnostic testing, you can forget about BMW looking into it. The part has to break down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously leased a 2007 328xi. Loved the handling and driving experience. Was surprised over time how it felt cheaper - meaning the driver seat creaked and an annoying creak in the parcel shelf in the back. And those run flats! Traded lease in early and got a 2009 328i. Purchased CPO. Low miles. Great deal. And what a difference. Silver, chestnut interior. Upgraded stereo, Xenons, heated seats. Feels like BMW made some nice changes. Interior quieter, tires don't make that hum (YET - let's hope not!). I looked at other cars (Mini, Honda, etc), but my heart sent me back to BMW. The handling and driving experience are like no other. New exterior changes are excellent!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The sedan's new updated look for 2009 is very nice. It also has a wider rear track which improves its stance from the rear. Front view is much more aggressive looking than 08 model. Fit and finish is near perfect. We purchased the Blue Water Metallic color which is gorgeous and not as common (everyone seems to have black)...we've received many compliments. iDrive is pretty simple and straight forward once you use it a little. The twin turbo engine has a nice growl when you start it and of course when accelerating....and boy does it move. Interior is a little snug...but not uncomfortably so. Overall VERY happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got the 328i as my first foray into BMW. I love it. Great driving experience and acceleration. Sure, the cup holders are almost unusable and the car needs to be on for the 3v power outlet to function, but I would've gotten a Suburban if those things actually mattered so much. I always look forward to getting behind the wheel after work!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice blend of luxury and sport. Easy to go 90 mph without realizing it. Great handling on turns and offers quick acceleration when ever you need it. Very fun to drive while looking good!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Extra wide back tires, the i-Drive, lights on the door handle (makes car glow like a spaceship at night), automatic adjusting side mirrors when backing up, ability to talk to BMW assist rep. When driving to get driving directions, built in theft detection system (like LowJack), Bluetooth works great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is fine if you want to pretend you're in a race with the other cars on the road. If you want a refined car with a transmission, throttle, and engine that work well together, buy a Mercedes C-class. This car is an example of how a well engineered car can also be very unrefined. If it had a manual transmission it would probably be much easier to drive. Some shifts are smooth, some are not, others happen when you least expect it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>By far, one of the greatest BMWs I have ever owned. Make that one of the best built, highly refined autos I have ever driven. Excellent power, great fit and finish, and just the ultimate driving experience. Bar-none, the best 2 door convertible available on the market today. And BMW makes it so easy to own with low financing and very easy credit. A+++</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the car for a couple weeks so far, and it's been a pleasure. Base model with auto trans and heated seats. Dealer agreed to replace the Bridgestone Turanzas with Continental RFTs prior to me taking delivery. Handling is fantastic, build quality outstanding. No issues so far whatsoever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased a 2009 BMW 335i hardtop convertible eight days and 600 miles ago. So far I love everything about this car. It's as fast as any car I've ever driven, and I owned two Corvettes. Traveling to NC from NJ I averaged 26.4 MPG. So far so good no problems at all and I hope it stays that way. A very elegant piece of German engineering loaded with the latest technology.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hardtop convertible, the no lag twin turbos, and contrary to other raters, the I drive, and the Nav are my favorite features. The Nav and I Drive are easier to use and superior to two other cars I've owned with Nav.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never thought of leasing a BMW, but someone very close indirectly recommended it to me. This is my first experience with a BMW and so far (first month) it has been very good. The xDrive system is quite good on ice and snow, but as other reviewers have commented, a delay in acceleration can be felt. Fuel economy is around 16 to 18 mpg in town and 28 to 30 on the highway. It may be too early to comment on the run flat tires.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Blk/blk auto w/sport package. This car is fast. It pulls hard like a V8 and has a great engine note. Since my previous cars were manuals I was hesitant getting the auto but with the sport mode it holds the gear longer & you can run it to redline. I like this a lot mostly coming out of a turn - you're always in the right gear. The new iDrive is light years better than the previous version. The car is an excellent mix of daily driver & rocket. I catch myself doing 90+MPH on the hwy, feels like 50 mph. It has all the latest technology anyone could need (bluetooth w/phone import, GPS w/lrg scrn, itune integration).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4yr pay nothing warranty. Itunes integration! Every car should have it. Well worth the $400. New black anthracite window trim on spt package, new iDrive and GPS screen. Front end & rear back quarter view styling. Elegant yet mean looking at the same time. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car! Looks great. Drives great and is scary fast. Very smooth so you have to keep an eye on speed. Mileage is about as expected (21 mpg overall so far). Compared to Caddy CTS, Infiniti G37, Audi A4, Acura TL. For driving feel and fun, BMW wins easily (G37 is closest). Had trouble with sun visor pulling out of headliner, which is now fixed. Also got a flat tire on way home from the dealership - run flats came in handy! The AWD seems to work well, but the tire grip in snow/slush/ice is not great. Overall, and expensive purchase, but I have absolutely no regrets.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, drive feel and performance are awesome! Heated seats and steering wheel (heat up VERY fast); folding side mirrors (nice in tight garage); overall, a great ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for 3 days and I can't stop driving it. It's a blast to drive and is a real head turner. The interior is way ahead of Infiniti and maybe even Audi. The car shifts sooo smoothly. Forget the G37, considering the deals that are available, it's time to buy the Bimmer! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have !2500 miles on this coupe and I love it. Top notch performance and styling. The handling is great. The mileage on the highway is OK (28 MPG) but not great around town (16MPG). I have had 2 Audis before this and I think that the Audi is better in the snow and the interior is superior but the BMW is much more solid feeling on the highway. Overall for me it is a toss-up. the deciding factor was the proximity of the dealers (10 mins vs. 40). Only regret is that I wish I had gotten the manual.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving in about 4 inches of unpaved snow, slush and ice: In straight lines it accelerates and stops under complete control. To test out the traction around corners, I took a couple turns at relatively unsafe speeds, close to 15 MPH. The DTS flickered and appeared to do something, but it definitely felt like I drifted out of my lane. During sensible speeds, drifting was not an issue. Slight hesitance may be confused with skidding, but its actually DTS doing its thing to keep you on your intended path. X-drive is very capable. However, I honestly feel Subaru sets the bar when it comes to AWD technology. Basically if you're looking for a luxury AWD coupé, look no further. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like how the windows slightly open/close when entry/exit from the vehicle, ensuring a snug window-frame to frame-of-car contact. Nice touch! You can really get a feel for the quality of build just by closing the heavy trunk lid. Seriously. Open and close one.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After test driving several makes and models, I bought the 335i xDrive with the sports package and nav. The car has been in the shop for approximately 2 of the 6 weeks that I have owned the car... so far (issues with a coolant pump). Car drives well on dry road but during our recent snow storm, the car had poor traction despite xDrive and the car slips and slides with the slightest braking. Most likely due to the tires that come with the Sports package. When I drove the 328xi loaner car, while my car was in the shop, it drove well in the snow. Overall, a good looking sleek car with good performance and features.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Naturally, the most favorite feature is the performance. Nav works great. I read reviews about how horrible iDrive is but, I thought it is overall very user friendly. Easy blue tooth hook up to the phone.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's about time that the U.S. gets the german performance diesels! This car is absolutely a blast to drive and the 425ft lbs of torque is felt very easily in your seat.

<TEXT>I recently purchased my BMW 335i xDrive and it is amazing. I took the car with all options available, and so in terms of aesthetics, performance and functionality, this car is sublime. I use to drive an Audi 2.0T Quattro, and though the cars are not meant to be compared, I can say without a doubt that the BMW ride quality, performance and driving experience are considerably superior. The interior layout is also on par with Audi's high-quality interiors. Overall, I must say that I'm happy I got this car over an A5... though I probably would have taken an S5, had there not been a 1yr waiting list! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The updated iDrive system for 2009, which I think is only available on a few models, is great! Everything is user-friendly and intuitive. There aren't too many options, and the shortcut buttons are key. Though I never played with the old iDrive, I'm very happy with this option! A must on an BMW!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took delivery this afternoon on a Tasman green/saddle brn '09 335i xDrive coupe. Said goodbye to my '06 330xi sedan, gave her a hug, and never looked back. My 330 was fast. But this coupe is stupid fast. Always thought my 330 was smart and had "a nice personality." But the 335 coupe is hot! Seriously considered the A5 Audi and VW CC. They're nice, very nice, but they are runner-ups. BMW needs to seriously ditch the run-flats. The cup holders are poor too (but you shouldn't drink and drive anyway, not in this car at least).</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchase our 1st BMW in December 2008. We test drove Audi A4, Infiniti G35, Lexus ES 359, Cadillac CTS and chose the BMW. My wife and I like all the features of the BMW 2009 model wagon down to the handling, The iDrive is not that bad once you get use to it. We currently have 600 miles and plan several trips this holiday. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Pros: Drives great and nice options. Fuel economy is great as long as you keep your foot out of it. For a man that's hard even with the 230 HP 6 cyl. If you need more speed you probably get more tickets.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First time owner of the BMW. Being from the Northeast, I?ve only driven AWD vehicles. I was well aware of the certain stigma clouding the x-drives, BMW being predominantly RWD and all, as well as the CDV issue. I can certainly put the CDV issue to rest. At first the minuscule delay will be noticeable, but after 200 or so miles of getting used-to, if you can?t adjust the feather of your foot to compensate for the delay, any discomfort from passenger head-banging is all on you. As for the AWD, haven?t had a chance to test it out yet this winter, but there is a difference between the xi and the 328i that I test drove in the dry, in how each gets off the line. The i is more responsive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The cross-wheel drive system. However, after the 1st gear, the bark and bite of each were very similar in character. Around the corners is where you?ll notice more of a difference, as the 328xi was able to carry more controlled speed through than the RWD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Would have given it all 10s but couldn't because of the flimsy exterior mirrors, the bad cup holder design and, worst of all, the run flat tires. These have to go, and as soon as I have the time I will get rid of them and replace them with regular high performance tires. The RFTs make the ride rough and the cost of replacing them is ridiculous. These tires are my biggest drawback about the BMW. Fuel economy isn't as good as I'd like but I'm not complaining about that because the performance of the car is excellent. Test drove the C-class, but once I drove the BMW I knew right away that its a much better car. Too early to tell about reliability, but so far its looking like a keeper. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car is a real beauty, especially with metallic paint and 17" wheels. People stare at it everywhere. Much roomier than it looks from the outside. Fits me perfectly. Tight handling. Feels rock solid on the road. Fast. Not as cheap looking inside as the C-class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2009 BMW 335i is even more fun than my previous 2006 BMW 330i. I had a great experience with my previous 330i and didn't think there was much room for improvement. The 2009 335i takes an already near perfect design and adds just a little more in a lot of area. The engine is something you just have to experience by driving the car. Great power at all speeds and seems to beg to be driven harder. The handling is great in the curves. The new iDrive is fantastic. This is not the sluggish iDrive system of the past. If you are into tech toys and can operate a modern cell phone you will love the new iDrive. If you like performance cars go test drive one. Just be prepared to want one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new iDrive/nav is great. Finally modern and easy to use. No longer sluggish to respond. Map look is very modern and intuitive. Ability to split the display screen with 2 different maps. The engine and handling - phenomenal. Apple iPod Integration - easy to use and control. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked up my 2009 335i xDrive a week ago and this car is amazing. I look forward to going to work in the morning to drive it. It seems to eat up the road and the 18" run flats with the sport package are unmatched. The growl the car make when you turn it on and step on the gas is worth the price alone. The stereo is incredible, iDrive is easy to use as well as the navigation. I am so glad I stopped in the dealership on the way to check on my Audi A5 that was on order. I drove this car and made the deal that night and drove down the street to cancel the Audi. I have had Acuras, Infinitis and driven my dad's Cayman S; this car blows them away. I will never buy anything but a BMW again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>iDrive and stereo, the iPod integration is great, you have all your music at your finger tips. Also you can rip CDs into the cars hard drive, so no more carrying CDs with you. The smooth transmission through gears, the car has a great sound.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I may have had the first 09 335i in all of CA while the rest were stuck in customs at the Long Beach Port in LA. This car is great! Fast, tight, great control, nice new body look with minor changes in the 09 in the exterior as well as on the interior. iDrive is so much better then old system. Great maps, options, usability, hard drive! And with the new twin Turbo which does its part to conserve gas this beast has power when you need it, and style when you are just rolling. Perfect mix of luxury and sport. The back seat is too small, but I guess thats why there is a 5 series.</TEXT>
