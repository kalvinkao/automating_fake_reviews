<TEXT>I have to say, when considering our first minivan, VW wasnt at the top of my list. However after reading thhe reviews here we decided to look. The first impression was shocking, WHAT A VAN! Great features for the price. Very fun and comfortable to drive. My wife who was resisting falling into the minivan crowd actually was so happy with this van she demanded we purchase it. We chose the SE w/RSE and there was an additional package that included the power rear lift gate and sunroof.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchase VW Routan this year and immediately noticed during the first week that the van pulls to the right. Took it to the dealer and they tried few things but no luck. They balanced tires, installed new ones and still the issue still present. I have contact VW customer service and reported to them of the problem. There is also a passenger side sliding door problem. The door will not stay latched open at incline. Overall, not happy with the van. I owned odyssey before and this van doesn't really compare well to Honda for the drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 3.8L engine is horribly underpowered and the transmission is too anxious to find a home in 6th gear. Trying to accelerate to get on the freeway leaves me depressed as I watch the fuel gauge race to the left faster than the car gains speed. The ride is smooth and the entertainment features make a ride of any duration tolerable. The interior features are pleasant and the exterior looks eerily similar to the Dodge and Chrysler. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our minivan three months ago. We have put on almost 3500 miles traveling long distances (NJ to NC and back) and we love the ride and ample storage ...our kids love the rear ent system . My gripe is with the design of the DVD player and the environment controls...too hard to read when driving. Yes I know this is a T&C with German suspension however I wish VW had input on enhancing the dash. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I wrote a review shortly after purchasing this van. While I still like it, I am very disappointed that we have to get ALL seven seats replaced because they are all tearing at the seam...even on some of the seats we don't sit on! First the passenger seat went and they replaced that seat. We went back to the dealership (not the dealer we purchased from - I am sure we would've gotten better service from them but they are much farther away) 2 months ago to show them the rest of our seats. We are still "waiting" for the parts to come in. I hope this doesn't happen to everyone else...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Routan SEL. The ride and the steering feel different enough to get you excited. It's not a Ferrari, but at least it doesn't drive and look like a Mommy wagon. The power doors are a godsend. So are the wireless headphones. The only drawback in my case is that they supply 2 headphones but I have 3 kids. I also like the 3-zone automatic A/C. The 4.0L gets the best gas mileage of all mini-vans sold in America, according to the EPA. I'm not seeing that kind of gas mileage yet, but the engine only has 950 miles on it, and most of our driving has been less than 10 miles at a time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just picked up our Routan and we couldn't be happier! There is NO CHOICE in my opinion when shopping for a minivan in this market. The alternatives are aged, bland and BORING. If you want exclusivity - get a Routan. It's gorgeous, handles superbly for a minivan, loaded with what you need, oozes techno gadgetry, reasonable price and 0% financing. For us it was an easy choice. The tough part was choosing a color.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We previously had a 07 Odyssey. We got the 09 Routan for the 0% financing, but have been blown away with how much we like it over the Honda. Driving down the road, it is far quieter. The drive feel is awesome, they nailed the suspension. This is a small thing, but the buttons for everything are in the right places, easy to find and use in comparison. We started out with a Voyager, Montana, Uplander, Odyssey, now Routan. The only negative thing I can find in reviews is that people resent that its a partnership with Chrysler and not pure VW. Get over it, this is an awesome minivan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I swore I'd never drive a minivan. Hate the way they look, hate the big size, hate the soccer mom stereotype. But then I met the Routan. It drives like a dream and was worth overcoming my hangups. Hubby says he feels like he's floating (tho only the SEL has the bigger engine). It is as beautiful as a minivan can get. Seats are very comfortable, handling is precise and nimble, and the VW styling is quite nice. Great cargo hold behind front seats; easy bluetooth with Uconnect; nice tailgate seats in back; plenty of cupholders, electric outlets, storage. I really wanted the RSE for the kids, but we couldn't afford it. Instead I bought 2 tablet style dvd players with headrest clamps. Perfect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have never owned a minivan and was suspect to performance. We have owned this for about a month and love it. Took it on a road trip over a weekend, put about 1000 miles on it and it felt great. Extremely comfortable, and instruments easy to use. Nav system is a must with interactive traffic redirection. Am getting about 15 mpg in the city and 25 on the highway.We have had to bring in for service once as condensation was building inside the headlight assembly. The transmission is smooth, but with 6 speeds the gear ratio makes for a lot of shifting.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Routan for exactly 30 days. On day 28 I was traveling with a friend and 5 kids. The transmission acted up and wouldn't go out of first. We were stranded in small town. Mind you my van only had 1050 miles on it. Anyway, the good is VW roadside was Awesome, they picked up the van delivered it to the nearest dealership and are fixing it now. They gave us a rental so I am impressed with VW service. They are replacing the valve body on my van and hopefully there will be no more issues. I love my van and am very hopeful nothing else goes wrong and this was just a fluke!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my new VW Routan last weekend as part of a cash for clunker deal. Have an SEL w/trim pkg 3 and navi. This will be our 3rd minivan since '90 (a '90 and '97 Dodge Gr Caravan) and so far like this one the best, lot's of little extras, comfy seats, great power and ride. Only rated it an '8' on reliability as we had a 'no-start' situation this past Monday but this is the reason for the review -- VW's roadside assistance arranged a tow to the dealer who handled it quickly -- it turned out to be loose connections in the master fuse panel. We have multiple cars so it was no bother as well as they updated the navi system once a complete check of electrical was done. Great job VW!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Any one who is in the market for a Minivan should consider the Routan. We traded in a 2006 Kia Sedona for our Routan and the Routan is a far superior vehicle. The Kia creaked, rattled and squeaked over every bump, but the Routan is rock solid and quiet. The seats are very comfortable and the highway fuel economy at 25mpg is very good for a van (Kia's best was 22). Our kids love the dual dvd player. VW did a nice job of improving upon the Chrysler van. Interior materials, ride and handling are better. I would recommend spending the extra money and getting the SEL pkg. The 4.0 engine is very strong and the 6 spd auto is buttery smooth. </TEXT>

The entertainment center is top notch, one of the best I have seen. the storage is great. Gas mileage has been horrible, 14 MPG in the city and 22 MPG on all freeway driving. I am getting better gas mileage in my truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Routan now has 9,500 miles, but so far so good. I recently traveled 156 miles (according to MapQuest) with a full tank. During our travel I stopped at a gas station at the destination and filled up the tank again out of curiosity--exactly 3 gallons was consumed for the 78-mile (one-way) trip. My Routan has averaged 26 MPG on HWY. I'm not sure whether it improved because of my mild driving habit or the expensive gas from Chevron. Still, it is awesome to know it has better MPG than Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey, even w/ its VCM Feature. This van has also been very comfortable--a typical asset of VWs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After extensive research, we opted with VW 2009 Routan SEL/w RSE because of the interior design, engine, reputation of German vehicles, offered discounts and largely for the 0% (zero percent) financing for 72 months. Although we like the Van, the Chrysler/Dodge engineering prevails over the VW quality and reliability. We owned the vehicle for a little over a month and we already have few problems. Within a week of purchase, the Van starts making a huge cloud of smoke and oily mixture comes out of the exhaust pipe whenever the engine is turned on. The dealer said that the PVC-valve has to be replaced in addition to few other things. Then when it rains, water gets into the headlight assem</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this van a month ago and have put over 2000 miles on it already. It rides and performs very well and I would recommend this to anybody. The rear entertainment system or VES as they call it is the best with two boys. The van is comfortable to ride and handles very much like a car. We test drove the Chrysler and then the VW and wow what a big difference. If anybody is looking for a minivan you must look at this. VW was offering some great rebates on the van as well and we saved over 10,000 dollars off MSRP!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my 09 Routan SEL for around 4 mo and about 4000 miles and disappointed does not begin to describe my state of mind!!! My brakes have been squealing since about the 1000 mile mark and it is "normal" according to a qualified technician. Both of my sliding doors have given me numerous problems, including not closing properly and I have come back to a vehicle with an open door. Gas mileage is atrocious. This vehicle has been a nightmare to deal with (especially with two young kids). Yes it is beautiful, but at what price? </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been an Odyssey driver for the last 5 years. When my lease was about to end I though I would lease yet another. But after checking out the Routan, I made the change. Sure it's a redesigned Chrysler, but you literally have to see and drive it to believe it. Dollar for Dollar, you get SO much more with this vehicle. Toss in the 0% financing and the $1000 conquest rebate (for converting from a Honda) and the other cash-back programs and it's a smarter use of your dollar.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think most professional car reviewers forget that most people who buy a minivan want features, space and comfort. The Routan has it all and it looks better than its Chrysler cousins both inside and out. Drives better too. The second row seats may not have the flexibility of the T&C but they have more comfort and the storage is still there which is the biggest selling point for me. I do wish the second row seats could be adjusted forward and aft but my boys (the third row occupants) are happy their sister can no longer squish their legs. I drove just about every minivan on the market and the Routan had the best mix of looks, comfort and features. Cheaper than the T&C and Odyssey too.</TEXT>

Need to get screens for dvd, hope they make it standard on higher sel model, but even without it the kids love it. My wife never thought she would drive a mini-van, but she loves our routan. Would highly recommend it for a family. Go with the 4.0l v6 as I felt the 3.8 was quite weak for my standards, but the 4.0 got a kick to it, make sure u drive both to tell the difference.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although there are many poor reviews of the Routan out there in cyberspace, most are written by folks who either haven't driven or don't own one. It is a great van, and drives nothing like the Town & Country. This is our first mini-van and have nothing but great things to say about it. It is superbly comfortable, quiet, and for the money (compared to Honda/Toyota) it comes well equipt. On a recent 1000 trip, it averaged 25.2 mpg (running ~70mph), which is impressive for a 4000+lb vehicle. It's future remains uncertain (Chrylser in Chapther 11, talk of not producing more Routans) this is a top notch van and I would highly recommend it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car. With twins on the way, we knew it was minivan time and dutifully test drove the Sienna and Odyssey. We looked at the Routan initially as an afterthought, but my wife was sold within minutes. The designers really understand how families will use this car, while the options and price VW crushed the competition. And, I have to admit, the car is fun to drive. the 4.0 v6 is powerful, I love the handling, the family is comfortable and, with the entertainment system, occasionally entertained on long drives. The nav system is terrific and the dashboard elegant and useful, particularly at night. I was a lifelong Toyota buyer, but not anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have test-driven and researched different minivans for months before buying one and when I decided to, the Routan came out. At first, I was hesitant for it's a Chrysler-made minivan. I test-drove it and find it to be much better and the best for many reasons: it runs very smoothly, the suspensions absorb rough and uneven surfaces on HWYs very well and road noise isn't noticeable at all compared to the Odyssey. It also looks more sophisticated than other minivans. It definitely feels VW. Maybe, with VW and Chrysler combined, you can't go wrong, especially in this century. People nowadays rarely keep their cars for decades, so if for any reason this vehicle won't last, I won't worry.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched for months before buying a Minivan and when I decided to, the VW Routan came out. Months prior, I have test-driven other minivans, but most have issues with either road noise/breaks or rattling. Then, I test- drove the Routan; I was impressed for it is very smooth, very quiet and does not produce road noise. The VW suspensions also absorb rough and uneven surfaces very well. I've been advised to go for the Japanese minivans, which are reliable. Well, they are, but I'd rather deal with thinking how long the Routan will last than dealing with road noise and rattling that will surely distract me every time I drive. With VW and Chrysler combined, it must be something?</TEXT>

However, I've been very impressed so far. My wife and I have owned 6 VW's and we can definitely say it has that VW feel and drive to it. It is a dream to drive versus our other car, a Honda Pilot. We also checked out the Odyssey, but it just didn't have a good driving feel to it and suffers the usual interior rattling we've had on all of our Hondas. So I'm glad we went with the Routan. It definitely has more VW to it than I expected.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>VW styling - front and back exterior modified vs T&C. Same for interior - Euro leather and VW's red/blue lighting (it's not on all, but a decent portion of interior lighting). The dual DVD system rocks. Also like the self leveling suspension to keep weight evenly distributed (handy on family trips).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am qualified to make the above statement as I own a Chrysler Town & Country and have driven the Dodge Grand Caravan several times prior to purchasing my Routan. Anyone who thinks this is the same car as the Dodge or Chrysler is sadly mistaken. The seats in the VW are definitely VW - more firm than the mushy seats of the other two. The engine on the base Routan which I have- the S- is the 3.8L Chrysler engine - not the 3.3L on the base Town & Country or Dodge. The interior design and the driving experience are VW. I have owned more than 6 VWs over the past 20 years and this van feels, looks and acts like a VW. Sharing an engine and body panels w/the other two make it no less a VW.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>VW styling, fit & finish, performance in a large family hauler at a lower price than comparable similarly equipped competitors. All the safety features come standard - front & side curtain airbags, ESP, ABS. Standard S model leaves nothing to be desired for a safe & fun family vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It got to the point where virtually every day of ownership meant something else on this barge didn't fall off, break off, peel off or just plain disappear! Electronics were especially "gremlin filled" nightmares. Door locks would stop working, then start locking or unlocking by themselves. Fuel gauge would sit there and pulsate F to E like it was alive! Dash lighting would fade to nothing at night, then come back on brightly until it repeated the blackout thing. After some negotiations, we took it into the dealer and drove out a new Tourag. Then I found out that this thing was built by Chrysler....now I understand! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Occasionally it actually was drivable! Rarely....</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There was no way I was going to buy a "mini-van" but my wife convinced me so I got her one for Christmas. Needless to say I was very impressed with all the features you get with a SE model. It drives like a dream and my daughter loves watching movies on car rides to the grocery store. Don't buy a mini-van, buy a Routan.... :-)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm not a mini van guy but we needed something that seats 7. If I was going to consider a mini van it would have to be a VW due to their style and class. I was very impressed with the overall design and style of the Routan. I love the captains chairs. They really give it a roomy but cozy feel. I recently found out that the Routan is pretty much a Chrysler with a few VW touches. I would still recommend a look and a test drive. It's still more hip than a Toyota, Honda, Chrysler ect.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride quality is nice and quiet. The brakes are quick and smooth. I really like the entertainment system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There have been many complaints about this being a rebadged Chrysler. For what it is, the Routan is outstanding. There is no way to get a Wolfsburg designed and built minivan to the U.S. in this price range. VW is trying to capture the market for their customers who already have a VW and need a family hauler. We have a Jetta, and needed more room for our growing family. While every aspect of it may not be "German Engineered," it surely is "German Inspired." The ride is great, the layout inside is well though out (we have a bench instead of the captain's chairs for the 2nd row, much more convenient in my opinion). Would definitely recommend. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride. For a van, it handles very well. Very quiet inside. Handles bumps well. Braking is amazing. Easy to get little ones in and out of. I don't feel as silly driving this as I would a Honda or Toyota.</FAVORITE>
