<TEXT>Bought the FIT for fuel economy and thought about long trips. Gas mileage is great, around town driving is wonderful,and turning is amazing to get into some of those parking spaces. Love the Aux input for the iPod/MP3. Freeway driving is loud and acceleration for on ramps is a lesson in patience and a little terrifying. Feel like I should get out and push. Wish we had held out for the manual but they were selling fast. And, what were they thinking about with some of the cupholders? The most convenient ones are in front of the vents. And, that space behind the cupholders on the gear shift stand.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage: currently averaging 39+, Aux input, rear seat alternatives; Honda name for reliability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Compared to and test drove Mini Cooper, Mini Clubman, Scion D etc. to replace a 1986 Toyota 4 wheel drive x'tra cab pick-up used for personal and small real estate business. With back seats down it works well to transport my mutts and for business. Did not like "paddle shifting"; standard is very responsive. Had dealer install moon-roof similar to those on accords and it is fabulous. Get all the rubber floor trays. Navigation system very useful and stability control makes my wife feel safe. Also got Plexiglas strips on doors for shade and rain protection as well as fancy door strips and a black rear bumper protector strip--all the bells and whistles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>VERY happy with car. Stereo is great, much better than I expected. Comfy supportive seat, nice instrumentation (blue is easier on eyes than red that many cars have now IMO), good smaller car for dogs. Smaller car than I'm used to, pep is ok but I'm more cautious driving in a smaller car. I expect a 10 for reliability but obviously haven't had it long enough to gauge, no worries there. Great job Honda! I don't feel bad not having a prius now. : )</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive, sporty, ipod usb, great stereo, rear seat versatility & storage box, great mileage, easy to wash. Nice accessory options, all weather mats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Began my love relationship with Fit in May '09. Many years with VWs, but Fit feels more spacious. Easy driving. Small enough to fit anywhere. Designed sharp enough to be noticed. Never want to be without a GPS again; so much fun to enjoy the scenery rather than having to remember landmarks. Loads of space and places to put drinks, eyeglasses, etc. Wide windshield and extra side windows feels like being in a tour bus. Great visibility. Road ride is fine; no worse than any other cars. GREAT gas mileage! The flexibility of the seats is a HUGE plus. Sadly I was totaled last week. Entire front end gone, but not me or my cat. Air bag worked. Nothing penetrated the cabin! Looking for a new Fit.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage between 35-41! GPS is fabulous: easy to use, finds great restaurants, will never be lost again. Love seat flexibility: lifting seats for extra hauling space is so easy; yet laying them flat is great to take animals and gear. Steering wheel controls keep eyes on road if using radio etc. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car because I was returning from overseas and needed a second car for commuting to work. After buying the car I received a 10- month assignment at a location 575 miles from my house, and I do that drive 1-2 times per month. If I knew I?d be driving that far so regularly, I would?ve purchased a car more composed at highway speeds. Highway performance is weak. At 80 mph, the engine turns nearly 4000 rpm, which is annoying and doesn?t give much cushion for passing. Short wheelbase equals bouncy ride. Braking is fair and should be improved. Rear drums and lack of VSC have caused instability during high-speed heavy braking.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned it for 2 mo. & used mostly for in-town driving, with a few 2+ hr trips, and is surprisingly agile and very easy to drive (although as noted elsewhere, not swift). Average mpg (actual, not from gauge, which measures through powertrain) is between 33-36. It's made several trips to Ikea, and can carry home 2 adults and a full size sofabed with no problems. Four tall adults fit very comfortably. Yes, interior is a little cheap looking, but look at the price you've paid -- it's great value for the money. I've rarely used the paddle shifters, but they'll come in handy when the snow starts falling. Wheel size limits me to alloy rims in aftermarket (I prefer steel rims on my snow tires).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the ipod connection. Stereo more than decent. So much interior space, and those magic seats truly are magic -- especially when buying tall plants. How can you not love that mpg? Rear wipers automatically come on when in reverse (it's the little things that count!).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really cannot believe that no one here addressed the Dash Reflection Problem on the Windsheild! I have an Image of the creases of the dash almost permanently glaring at me which I find annoying. When the sun shines the reflection of the dash is worse. It's right there straight ahead while driving. A big distraction. Also the illumination of the headlights are weird. They do not go that far out! Mainly downward to a black line. They also do not shine to the side very well, I have trouble making a turn because the lighting is not there. I think the strange headlight design is the reason.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very fun to drive and zip around with. I purchased this after missing the space of an SUV but wanted the great mileage as well. Less than a month and I'm getting 38.8 mpg mostly on highway driving going mostly 65 mph. Love the interior space especially the magic seats. Very versatile in that aspect. Acceleration is not as bad as I thought it would be and the fog lights, interior lighting, dash lights and speakers are a plus. The second glove compartment and ipod/aux jacks are cool too. There's really not a whole lot to complain about for the money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of pockets and cargo space. Magic seats and headrests are awesome! Very fun to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in an 2009 Civic Si for the Fit Sport and so far am very happy. Of course it does not have the HP of the Civic but the overall drive, visibility, utility and fuel economy cannot be beat within it's class. Having had the car for one week I just re-fueled and calculated an average of 43mpg (on-board display read 47.6mpg) with a 70/30 highway/urban commute. Highway handling is not quite as tight as the civic due to the higher profile, but handling and maneuverability around town more than compensates. I almost bought a MINI but needed the extra space and four doors, and this Fit the profile. Will update after the first oil change.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Fit in March of 2009. I've had the car for 3 weeks now, and love it. I purchased my Fit as a second car, my primary car is a Honda Accord. I purchased the vehicle, because I travel to clients daily, and I wanted a car that was good on gas, reliable, and comfortable. I looked at the Toyota Yaris, I didn't like the center dash, and the Scion, but I liked the Fit better. The car is very roomy inside, I'm 6'0 and weigh over 300 Lbs., and I'm very comfortable, even on trips over 1 hour. After 3 weeks, I have no complaints at all, and I'm very happy with my purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my 2009 Fit Sport for 3 1/2 months and must say this is one of the BEST cars I have ever had. The gas mileage is MUCH better than the sticker. The lowest mileage I have seen is 34 MPG (that's mostly city driving, too!). It "fits" me well, very comfortable, lots of room for storage, handles like a pocket rocket and 'turns on a dime'. The folks at Sunny King Honda took excellent care of me and treated me like an intelligent buyer, not just a "monthly payment". The service department has been tremendous, their level of care and professionalism is outstanding. I would suggest BOTH this car and this dealership if you're in the market for true Honda Quality. The FIT is GO!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the USB port. I can store 80 albums of music on a jump drive and control it all from the head unit. Really convenient. Lots of storage and space for STUFF. Great car for road trips. And the fuel mileage is excellent; best I've seen besides a hybrid.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a month of hour long commuting each day I'm satisfied with purchase of vehicle but wish it had more power and a more comfortable front seat. Cars whiz by me going uphill and by the end of the drive my back is tender. On the positive side, gas mileage has been better than advertised and the hatchback storage with fold down back seats is great for suitcases to the airport or golf clubs. Caution against purchasing black like I did as vehicle gets hot inside during warm weather with the dark upholstery and large glass windshield and windows.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Honda Fit drives like a sports car, carries cargo like a small SUV, reduces environmental impact and fuel consumption like a hybrid without the cost and complexity and is build solid and strong (no rattles, no squeeks no leaks). My mpg is averaging 40.7. The only hesitation was the size because I have never owned a car in this size category (subcompact). So far I think I made a good decision.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just before my daughter returned from Afghanistan I bought her a Fit Sport with Navigation. I liked it so well, I bought one for myself. Hers is Blue Pearl and mine is Black Pearl. Hers has some optional goodies such as center armrest, sport grill, all weather floor mats, door sill plates and rear bumper applique. She also added an aftermarket remote start system. I just opted for the arm rest and floor mats. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Got the base Fit because the only feature I really wanted on the Sport was cruise control, and that wasn't worth the extra price. Keyless can be added by buying the transmitter keys online, and I negotiated with my dealer to do the key cutting and programming for free. If you're thinking Base versus Sport, the Base model rides a bit smoother and gets a bit better mileage, while the Sport is definitely "sportier" and it does have a lot of nice add-ons that you may or may not place a great value on. The Base also has a lighter color interior that you may or may not prefer over the Sport.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm 6'3 200lbs and plenty of room to spare in the car. I love manual transmission cars, and wow is the Fit a real treat. They've designed the engine in such a way that there is always enough over-lapping torque. Ie. Downshifting especially in traffic is extremely smooth. As a result, I'm never hesitant about going in overdrive. Unlike almost all other manual shifting cars, the Fit seems to always get enough air into the engine. It feels like it has the lung capacity of Michael Phelps inside Shawna Johnson's body. It may sound odd to others, but I actually love to drive this car slow. The engine really knows how to purr with little sips of gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a white Honda Fit in November and just love it. I did a lot of research before deciding on the Fit and don't regret my decision at all. In fact, I don't feel envious at all of those more expensive luxury models on the road. The Fit is very practical, but still manages somehow to have a sense of fun. Many people who thought I was crazy for buying a Fit are now very impressed. Overall, a very well thought out little car that doesn't feel cramped.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>By far the back seat versatility. Lots of usable cargo space. Actually got 40mpg on highway with cruise control feature. Convenient double glove box. FAST heater in winter.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>You'll be smiling too - you don't even need to be an engineer to appreciate all the talented design and manufacturing expertise that went into this car. In 40 years my wife and I have purchased new - one BMW, one Porsche, one Audi, one Subaru, one Toyota, 3 Hondas and 2 Acuras (Hondas w. more buttons). The 5 Honda products were retained an average of 8 years each, the 3 Germans only 3 years each. In my book, Hondas have the best balance of fun to drive, comfort, long term reliability and low total ownership cost. That makes me smile.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>USB connection provides iPod charging - plus menu and control thru the in- dash Nav's touch screen. Cargo volume is amazing. Comfortable seating for 4 large adults. Fun to drive in the twisties. Zippy looking.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Now that I've had my Fit for a while, I have one follow-up note for you all. I still love my Fit -- it's fun to drive, fuel efficient, safe and reliable, and it looks cool. But there is one issue that you need to know about. The front end is very low, and you may end up scratching it on driveways. I already have twice. The scratches are not noticeable since they are underneath the front end, but if you are fastidious about your vehicle's condition, it may bother you. You have to almost stop at speed bumps and steep driveways to avoid scraping paint off the bottom of the front bumper. If it were an inch higher, this wouldn't be an issue. Nevertheless, I still recommend the new Fit.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my FIt in January, and have been driving it over 300 miles/week ever since. My favorite feature is the folding seats. The gas mileage keeps creeping up, and is currently averaging ~38 mpg (mostly highway driving, some of which is quite hilly). The car is slow to accelerate getting on freeways, but drives effortlessly once it is up to speed. Unfortunately, at 5'8", the seat/headrest forces me to slouch. I have yet to rig a pillow set-up that solves this problem, and I wish I didn't have to. Also, I am disappointed with the car's low clearance. Overall, I'm happy with the car, and feel that it's probably the best option if you're longing for a hatchback - they're the best!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good gas mileage, lots of airbags, great storage options (I'm an aspiring urban farmer, and serious storage matters), I anticipate this will be a reliable car for many miles.</FAVORITE>

For the money, this car is a super value and needs to be taken seriously!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had it a few weeks so I can't judge the reliability yet. But I feel cool riding around in such an efficient car during this recession; would be embarrassed to be driving a BMW. Have put several hundred miles on it and found the seat comfortable for my back even on a day I drove for over 4 hours, though most of my trips are short. With regard to other reviews, I don't find it any bumpier or noisier than my last car, a 2006 VW Jetta, or most mid-priced European cars I've driven. But I imagine it would be quite a bit bumpier and noisier than say a full size American car, so it depends what you are used to.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Extreme cuteness of the exterior styling, great mpg, price, visibility (much better than Prius or Insight out back), regular gas, sliding leather armrest accessory, easy to park in city, handles and accelerates fine for normal, sane people.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had to update my initial review because I was amazed at the gas mileage after my most recent fill-up. I set the trip meter to zero at my last fill-up and filled up again last night with 237 miles on the trip meter. It took 6.29 gallons to fill up completely which means I got 37.7 mpg! That is with a 40/60 mix of city and hwy driving at average hwy speeds of 65 to 70 mph. I generally shift at between 3,000 rpms and 4,500 rpms, so I'm not babying the car either. What is even more amazing is I just broke 1,000 miles today and I'm getting that kind of mileage. Imagine how much better the mileage will be after the engine if fully broken in. I love this car! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy! The EPA numbers are WAY off. The only way you can get a Fit to record such poor mileage of 27 city/33 hwy is to constantly shift at redline and drive 90 mph with the A/C on full blast on the highway. Under "normal" driving conditions the gas mileage blows the EPA numbers away.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought our Honda Fit 2 weeks ago after test driving the Toyota Yaris, and Hyundai's Elantra and Accent first. So far we absolutely love our new car. We purchased the Metallic gray color and it looks great. We bought our car at Branfond Honda in Branford, Ct. and the salesmen Joel was straight forward and worked with us on price even before we came to the showroom which convinced me to go and take one for a test drive. The car rides smooth, handles great, and is fun to drive. We like it enough I would like to purchase another one soon. This is another fine product Honda has produced. My wife has an 18 year old Accord which is what helped convince us to go with Honda again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looks for an economy car. I would have preferred that they eliminate the fabric on the top portion of the doors though. I expect that it will not hold up as well as the vinyl on the rest of the doors. Also even if it cost a little more Honda should make floors mats standard.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife just picked up her Honda Fit Sport with nav this weekend and really loves it. Can't say much about reliability since we just got it, but the last 2 Hondas we had were trouble free. Traded an Element and don't feel short on space. The visibility, comfort and features are really great. It's good to see a manufacturer offering some high end features in a sub-compact. The nav is very nice out ot the 3 navs we have. Visibility is great with all the glass. I'm 6-2.5 and fit fine in the car. Ride is very comfortable. Not a powerhouse but didn't expect it to be, and it's adequate for normal driving. The exterior is really nice with the sport package in metallic grey.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Fit is the perfect vehicle to accommodate the new economic reality. It's relatively inexpensive to purchase, comfortable, versatile, reliable (it's a Honda!), very fuel efficient, inexpensive to insure, good looking, safe, inexpensive to maintain, and more fun to drive than any economy car has a right to be. It's simply the right car for the times.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving all US products, most being of the midsize or full size variety, I am pleasantly impressed with this Honda import. It is a far cry from the FWD 4cyl cars from the 1980s I had driven and it brings some Asian/European design characteristics that have been sorely lacking from US products. My other vehicle is a 2000 Ford F150 with a 4.2L V6 and 5 spd manual OD so the Sport paddle shifters were something I liked rather well given that I want to have more control over gear changes. My wife loves the regular auto mode for her driving. It is fast enough for normal mortals and feels firm and responsive. It is too early to give MPG, but did 26.5 on a mixed test drive at dealer.</TEXT>

Not trying to be funny, but everything really does 'fit'. I have had it full of people, cargo, and dogs without a problem. As for snow, there is about 4 inches on the ground here today and I didn't get stuck once during my 45 mile commute (I don't even have snow tires yet). This truly is an amazing engineering feat. Why buy a Mini at twice the price?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well researched purchase,I considered the matrix but chose the fit due to better rear visibility and more fun features. Love this car: small but versatile, fuel efficient, affordable, lots of safety features. Main complaint is the bumpy ride: doesn't handle rough roads well, and downright bouncy (seems to oscillate off the ridges in the concrete) on certain stretches of well maintained freeway. At 5'1" I find the interior comfy, but my 6 ft friend feels cramped. Sun visor is inadequate for a short person when flipped to the side. Gas tank is small but mpg (I avg 33 for about 75% hwy driving) makes up for it. Handles snowy roads well, but I do worry I?ll get stuck with low clearance in front.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car, very happy. Bought one two days ago and have put 500 miles on it. The seats are stiff but supportive and i have no issues with long drives. The suspension is stiff but i enjoy the control the vehicle has. It feels sporty enough for getting 39 mpg on my first tank. Really enjoy the interior space. For the amount you spend on this car its worth every cent. I would definitely suggest the manual over the automatic, those paddle shifters were interesting but hardly useful.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2009 Fit Sport 5-speed manual in January 2009, and I am really happy with my purchase despite some suggested improvements (see below). In some ways the Fit seems like the reincarnation of my 1980 Civic 1500 wagon, but with lots of evolutionary improvements. I also considered the Mazda 3 hatchback and the Suzuki SX4 Crossover, but the Fit?s combination of styling, roominess, and economy was impossible to beat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an '07 Fit which I loved. After visiting the dealership for an oil change I saw the '09 and had to drive it. I don't know how, but Honda, once again has proven it can make the best even better. I bought the '09 with navigation and love it. Now I own two Fits. After years of being a Chevy driver and switching to these Hondas I will say I don't miss having my car in the shop every other month; and to top it off, Honda actually honors their product warranties unlike Chevy. I guess that's why some are making it in this economy and others aren't.</TEXT>

My only gripe is the exceptionally harsh suspension - driving in New York City's pock-marked pavements or cracked concrete surface will shake your brain cells out.

<TEXT>Great car! I shopped around for a year for something small, highly efficient, safe, and fun to drive. Almost settle in the SX4, but heard the the '09 Fits were coming out early, so I ordered one. Far superior fuel economy than the Suzuki, and you can't go wrong with Honda's reliability record. There is so much space in this car it's like driving an SUV you can feel good about (and safe in). I'm still getting used to the looks though. It's a bit too modern for me. I like the 07/08s better, but the 09 has improved over the previous gen. in every other way. I actually get compliments on it all the time though. Mine is orange. Consistently getting 34-38 mpg. I love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We built a new home and went from 2.3 mi to 23 mi commute, about 18 miles on 2-lane state highway. After much research, I settled on the Fit to replace my 10 yr old F150 for the drive. After 2,500 miles, avg. 34.3 MPG (about 4 less than given by the trip odometer!). Handles well, ride is great but a little noisy, good cargo and passenger room, dash and controls are excellent. Smooth downshift and accelerate out of turns. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Fit is a tremendously fun car to drive. Power is more than adequate and the fuel economy is good (at least with the manual). I am fairly tall (6'1") and the fit is very comfortable with the seat in the rear-most position. Anyone taller would have a problem. The ride is stiff, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The drivers seat is a bit too hard as well. The only significant drawback is the very stiff ride. This has got the firmest suspension of any car I've ever driven.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Do not believe the hype. The engine is buzzy and the transmission hunts for the right gear. The ride is extremely bumpy, you feel everything. The seats are uncomfortable, and can't be height adjusted. You would never take this on a trip longer than 25 miles. It has beautiful styling, but that's all. A huge disappointment that I bought into because of all of the raves from the so-called car experts. I'm trading this in on a larger and more comfortable car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got the 2009 Fit Sport AT yesterday. I'm very happy with the acceleration and handling when entering the highway. I'm getting 35 mpg so far in mixed highway/city traffic (in Houston). However it looks like the mpg will continue to increase. Visibility is excellent and the Nav is easy to use. Voice command can be a source of hilarity. The ride is smoother than my Subaru WRX but a little rougher than Honda Civic. Cockpit feels airy and open. Driving position/feel is a cross between driving a small sedan (Civic) and a small SUV (Element).</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car for the size and price. It does not feel like you are in a small car while driving it. There is ample space in the front seat area. We are tall and have no problem. I love the mpg monitor even though it does run 2-3 mpg higher than calculated mpg. Most of my driving is stop and go and mpg have been ~29. USB input is great. The controls on the dash are large and easy to operate, very user friendly. The car heats up quickly in the cold. I did add the arm rest center console and it is nice. The engine does get loud when I hit the gas too hard. Overall this car is fun to drive and I am so happy I have it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car one week ago on Dec 20, 2008. I am very happy with the 09 Fit Sport. I had the 07 Fit Sport but it was totaled by the insurance company. I enjoyed the 07 but on a longer drive the 09 feels smoother to me and to be very honest, it is a much more pleasant drive! I love driving around in my new car because I love the way it handles. I would give higher marks in performance but pulling away at red light and uphill is hard. Going uphill on an interstate is hard... your MPG get really low it is a bit slow to do. Fuel economy is ok, for me as advertised thus far. Interior needs a center console so took points off for interior.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the Fit Sport with navi in manual transmission - it has VSA and ABS. It has excellent handling in the snow. 2 days ago we had snow here in New York, and in our area we had about 6 inches. I decided to try out the ABS system and the VSA system of the car. So I drove on streets that were not yet plowed, particularly on those with some elevation, so the car had to climb. Having manual transmission, I was able to drive slow, (the proper way of driving in snow). I was in full control all the time. Not once did the wheels spin or slide - because the VSA corrected it immediately. I was passing SUVs and minivans in the Palisades Parkway who could not make in elevated inclines. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The concept of this car is perfect. Hatch, small, efficient, stability control. My main complaint is that the suspension is way too harsh. Not firm, which is OK, but harsh. You feel EVERY road flaw. The MPG is averaging 30, mediocre for a car with this modest level of power and performance. The transmission constantly shifts on even small grades, annoying. Handling is excellent. Very roomy and versatile. Excellent interior. My VW pickup rides better. Don't buy one until you put on 50 continuous miles on a concrete highway and broken city streets. If you can live with the incessant jittery ride and average MPG, very strong in other areas. I'll be trading on a Civic or Mazda 3 soon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I will add more to this review later, but my initial impressions are very good. I don't have a long commute or drive a lot as other Fit consumers do, but I still got this because I know Honda's are reliable, I like the new Fit's design and performance specs compared to the older versions and I wanted to be environmentally conscious. I sold my 2001 Jeep Cherokee and am glad to finally be past the SUV phase of my life. Getting used to the 4 cylinders will be interesting, because the Fit just doesn't have a lot of power. But it's so low and aerodynamic that it still zips around and is fun to drive. So far I love the Fit. I think it's a great value for the money in this economy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first vehicle I've owned in 30+ years that makes me want to drive. It's no sports car but it's still a hoot! On decent roads the engine smoothly hums along and the car is quieter than my 2000 Accord. The noise level does pick up when the engine is pushed but it seems willing enough and the transmission shifts with precision. It rides very nicely on good roads but things get somewhat choppy on rougher surfaces. However, the car remains very composed on all surfaces and is very easy to handle. Gas mileage in lows 30s around town and low 40s on highway. A lot of thought went into this design!</TEXT>

Went to my local dealer and put a deposit on one even before they came in... the car was that much in demand. Glad I did. It is amazing. Not as fast (or flashy) as the Acura, BUT, it is so nimble and just plain fun to drive. The folding rear seats (up and flat) allow for an AMAZING amount of room! Don't miss the Acura at all. Average just around 37-38 mpg in city driving... and sometimes I really push using the paddle shifters :-). Test drove many cars before I settled on the Fit. Easily outclasses ANY car in its class.

<TEXT>We got this looking for a cheaper and more versatile replacement for a Lexus IS, and have been very pleased. Fit-and-finish are excellent despite some cheap materials. We've been getting ~30 MPG in city driving, and got 33 on a highway trip with two adults, two kids in car seats, and luggage. The transmission needs to downshift to maintain 70 MPH on steeper grades, but does so pretty unobtrusively. More hamsters under the hood wouldn't hurt. Road noise is OK for the price. Low-speed handling is excellent, but the Fit feels tall in tight turns at speed. Navi is very easy to use. The USB connector works fine with iPhone and a 1st-gen iPod nano.</TEXT>

Owned it for 30 days and the fuel stats are super. Worst MPG was 29.9 with the first tank of gas and that was mostly stop and go St. Louis metro driving. Overall mileage is 38.4 MPG after 900 miles. One highway only driving trip averaged 44.9 MPG while the computer estimated 46.9 MPG. I have 60% city/urban and 40% interstate driving.

Well, they were all astonished to see how well I Fit into this small car. And I drove off with my mountain bike safely stowed in the back. This car is amazing value; I love driving it compared to my previous Audi A6 mainly because it sips fuel. But also it's just plain fun to drive. My advice: if you can handle manual, go for it.

<TEXT>I downsized from a larger, more powerful vehicle, and while I love the functionality, gas mileage, and looks of the Fit, in the month and 1,600 miles I've had it, I haven't been able to get really comfortable in the driver's seat. I'm 6'5" and the road test seemed okay, but after sitting in it a while, I sure wish the seat was more adjustable and went farther back. The center armrest should be standard, too (and lower, and designed for use with a manual transmission; the current one will not be installed by Honda on a MT). Otherwise, though, I think it's a great little car, and runs well both around town and on the highway. It's moderately zippy, has a great turning radius, and is open.</TEXT>

Initially I was going to get an '08 but they couldn't find the "tidewater blue metallic" I wanted so they offered to order me an '09. I was unsure of the body style if I would like the subtle changes but when seeing it in person, I was in love. I love how it drives, love how it handles, love all the space. It is a great car, the best car I've had so far and do not have any regrets. The biggest plus is the outstanding gas mileage when driving all highway, I average almost 39/40 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a used '95 Nissan Altima for many years (and it now costing more to fix than it is worth each year), I decided to purchase a new car. I am very glad I waited for the 2009 Fit. It sounds much better than the 2008 when driving. It is very comfortable to sit in, the stereo sounds great, and the display lights are easy on the eyes. It provides a lot of storage space for a small car. I have to cart my recycle garbage can to a central dump site and occasionally buy large things to cart home (e.g., today, four 4'x 3.75' sheets of plywood). I love that the seats fold up or down to provide the extra space. I purchased the sport only because the base did not have cruise control.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A lot of space, comfortable seating, great gas mileage, fun to drive, nice display lights, cruise control, Magic seats, and bright headlights. Averaging about 42 mpg during my first 700 miles (~60/40 and 55 mph on highway), although it is easy to speed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had an '07 Fit and was very happy, but there were some design flaws - front window and seating. I recently purchased 09 sport with navi and am IN LOVE. The difference is like comparing a real car to a toy, not that the 07 was bad, it's just the way of all cars, 2nd gen is better than the first. Also, the car talks - how cool is that?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navi - great ride much smoother than the 07 FIT. More stability when going fast. The exterior is much more designed and sleek.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Thank God I read all of the owner reviews. I would not have looked at this car, because I'm not crazy about the front end (looks like a snarling cat). But all of the good reviews were right on target. It is VERY comfortable (leg room, head room, cargo space), and drives like a dream. I am missing the remote key entry and cruise control, but if I had chosen the Sport model they were included. My only complaint is that the base model really could use some front arm rests. And yes, I am getting 42 miles per gallon!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is one incredible value! In fact, I declared it the best value on the market after I shopped around for months. I wanted a practical car in which I could fit my big dog and bikes upright, a fuel efficient car, something sporty, and a car that had aesthetic appeal all at a reasonable price. My short list included only the Fit when I was done. I thought about the Prius, but this car offers an entirely different level of value. It is surprisingly roomy when you get in and has decent pick up for the engine size. I also like the ipod capability and shifters. On the way home from the dealership, I averaged 39 mpg, including mountains with the a/c on and I passed a Lexus up the hill.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had the car for a couple days and I already love it. The interior space, high mpg, overall design, and driving experience are great. Although, I don't really need the nav system, I do enjoy it and love the voice activation feature. It's just a great all around car that looks pretty cool in black. And for a little car with 117 hp/107 ft.lbs. torque it's a fun little car to drive and the 5 spd manual is spot on. This car deserves some awards from the automotive press for sure "Of the Year" or "10 best" you know who you guys are! Way to go Honda!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been in an Acura TL-Type S for 3 years and debated downsizing to something less expensive and fuel efficient. I saw the 08 Fit and was waiting for honda to make improvements like VSA and Nav. I decided to order the 09 Fit Sport and have NEVER regretted this decision! I have researched hybrids & know that the environmental impact of the battery system is massive--so will wait for some new tech.

<TEXT>This is our first Honda. We also have a 2007 Nissan Altima which we love, but wanted a true economy car for short hops as well as commuting. We fell in love with the 2008 Fit we drove but decided to wait for the 2009 since we were intrigued with the new body style and what sounded like some new features. We're thrilled with the car after the first week. The quality and comfort are first rate. The mileage is running at 42 mpg for the first few hundred miles.

<TEXT>I drive two small children, their car seats and a double stroller around San Diego on a daily basis, and I am glad I chose this car. The cargo space behind the rear seats is cavernous for a car this size. The legroom in the backseat is awesome, but I haven't been seeing the stellar gas mileage everyone else is getting. With 60/40 driving its average is 30 mpg with 200 miles on it so far. I'm sure that will improve. I'm not too impressed with the a/c. It was barely cranking out any cold air and the past few days were over 100. This car could also use darker tint on the rear windows. And I'm having a few issues with the power door locks. The red with chrome wheels turns a lot of heads.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I don't get where some reviewers feel this car can get pricey. This car has excellent quality, is fun to drive, and is super practical, without ever feeling like an entry level car (unlike a Yaris or Versa). I traded in a 2006 MINI for my Fit Sport, accepting a loss in the "fun to drive factor" Was I wrong! The car is a hoot to drive. It's composed, sporty, but doesn't tire you out. No, it's not a MINI, but its more practical, cheaper, and surprisingly, gets a lot of looks by people on the street. Given the poor service history I received with my MINI compared to the reputation of Honda service, I look forward to a long relationship with this "Big" little car!</TEXT>

Driving home from work I am relaxed and comfortable and the sound system is wonderful. Am able to plug in a USB (jump drive) and play music straight from it and switch between sources with the touch of a button. Also the space is great! The seats are easily adjusted and everything is just perfect! No blind spots at all. There is also an armrest which is a plus. This is also my first manual transmission and its easy as could be. I would recommend this car to anyone! Also love the panoramic view! AC is great too!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the Fit. The mileage is amazing. I'm getting 32 mpg in the city and 40+ on the highways. This blows the EPA estimates out of the water (28/33). The gauges at night are beautiful. The MPG gauge really helps maximize fuel economy by showing current and average MPG at the same time. The paddle shifters are very cool and help maximize economy too. You can lock into 5th gear when cruising so the transmission never down shifts when going up hills. I just love this. This car's MPGs are right in line with my Yaris liftback that has nowhere near the room or features. The USB flash drive player is so very nice! Do yourself a favor and drive the '09 Fit Sport. You will LOVE IT!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a Honda fan and had been looking at the Civic . I had seen the Fit from a distance and thought it was too small. When you really look at it seriously, you will become a believer in the Fit. It has plenty of power. You can drive in the high RPM with paddle shifter, but you will suffer on the MPG. It has all the power features. There are many seat configurations and are easy to adjust. I just got my first real mileage numbers in 75 highway/25city driving: 39 MPG and I wasn't trying to conserve fuel. Everyone in my family is enjoying driving the Fit. </TEXT>

I have driven the car for 600 miles in almost all city driving and have gotten 30 mpg. I have owned other cars that had the same or better EPA estimates that did not come close to this mileage (usually 25 mpg). With 2009 all models get telescopic a telescopic steering wheel that allows anyone a comfortable driving position. In the sport version you get a lot of nice extras. The ride is excellent in this vehicle. The balance between handling and comfort is perfect. The navi system is also excellent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having had the car for two days and 200 miles, this is an initial impression only. It took a bit of time to get the steering wheel and seat adjusted to me but now my only comfort complaint is lack of leather. The manual is VERY forgiving and took a bit of getting used to as the fit replaced a Porsche 944S2 Cab 5M. Handling is tight. Good visibility. GREAT use of space with the variable seat positions. The AVG MPG display has me pegged at 40.4 with 25%city and 75% hwy and was at 41.8 after the first 120 miles of 95% hwy driving. Can't argue with that.

<TEXT>I did a good amount of research on the Fit before getting it. I knew going into it that the sport suspension was going to be great for driving, but rough on unforgiving roads. The same goes for the motor. I knew that the Fit did not produce a lot of horsepower. For what it is given, it is fun to drive. It is the right amount of power for a single driver who wants to push it on the local interstate. Storage on the Fit is prefect for the size of the car. As long as you know you can't try to fit a mattress into a Fit. Lastly, I suggest spending a little extra and get the Mugen and Sport add ons. It helps make the little guy stick out among the other Fits on the road. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When my 2002 Taurus had reached the end of its useful life, I wanted a car that would be far more reliable with a superior fuel economy. I ended up looking carefully at the Yaris, Accent, Versa, and Fit, eventually choosing the latter. For the price, you will be hard pressed to find a better designed and built car with as much versatility. It is not a luxury vehicle, but comes with a surprising array of features. Yes, the Fit is a couple thousand more than others in its class. In the end, it comes down to the superior quality of the vehicle when compared against others in its class, particularly the Versa. This is a highly functional, well designed, efficient car that is also fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Most reviews here highlight everything well: you buy a Fit for superior engineering, reliability, and fuel economy. On top of that, the cargo space and interior versatility are unbeatable.

<TEXT>I bought the base, manual model because I'm cheap, and I love to drive manual transmissions. I had good luck with my 2002 Honda Civic, but wanted the versatility of a 5 door. It's a hoot to drive, light steering, clutch. 40 MPG highway Fantastic seat maneuverability makes space behind driver usable in many different ways. Build quality is excellent. Surprisingly quiet for a small car with high revving engine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought one week ago. Only the 2nd new car I have purchased in 40 years of driving and I have no regrets. Had it on the PA Turnpike this past weekend, getting almost 38 MPG...not bad for having less than 800 total miles on it. City driving looks like it will average about 30 MPG. Both these are better than EPA, but if you check out Truedelta or Fuelly websites, some people are making wild claims that make it sound like it's a super-hybrid...look at site results and figure to be in the middle of the charts. Lots of debate over MT vs AT. I bought the AT with the paddle shifters, which are kind of a novelty but fun and efficient to use. It's not a race car, but has plenty of zip and fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of room, excellent MPG, nice stereo system with USB port for flash drive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2009 Fit is larger and I think better than the 2008. The actual vehicle looks better then the pictures. The acceleration was very good for this car. The handling was also very impressive. I just bought the car a couple of days ago. I'm waiting to see what mpg I can get. It has a mpg gauge which is very useful. The interior is great. The fit and finish is what you would expect from Honda. It seats five people in relative comfort (only if you're not overweight). The car was better than what I had expected. Another great car from Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned the 2009 Fit for just one week, but I have some valuable feed- back so far. Surprisingly, I have averaged between 34-35 mpg on my first tank of gas, significantly better than I expected. I read earlier customer reviews that complained about the 2008 fit's inadequate Air Conditioning. I understand their concerns but I think I have found the reason for their complaints. The front seat passengers are exposed to quite a bit of sunlight with the position of the windshield and the tall side windows. The AC is fine, but when you are exposed to direct sunlight, you will feel hot. Window tint is essential to remedy this concern. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought and received an 09 Fit Sport. Feels very tight, and the first hundred miles are amazing. It's getting substantially better mileage than the EPA ratings. The car tracks very true and feels like a more expensive vehicle. The interior is finished very well and the changes from the 08 model are the perfect improvements. The wheels have a very sporty look to them and it sticks to the ground nicely. Radio is fantastic and the interaction with the iphone is perfect. Overall I would rate this vehicle as as close to 10 as you can get The price and quality are second to none.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've taken our son 400 miles each way to college this last week. The MPG was 28.5, ride was Okay at best (I'm 6'1") the seats are not designed for the long haul. However, because we were trying to make time on our trip I was driving an average speed of 80 pushing 90 on occasion. THIS car's suspension is that of one much more expensive. Weaving in an out of traffic the handling was beeee U Teee full... It was almost as though the car wanted to be driven hard. On the downside. YOU CANNOT move a kid into a dorm in this car. No room at all for 4 passengers and cargo. 3 passengers maybe if you fold down the rear seat. The engine is buzzy at 80+ but you ignore it after a while. Still in Love. ;0)</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was a replacement for my 99 Blazer (Cash/Clunkers), after 3 weeks I am happy with my Fit. It is much roomier on the inside then it appears from the outside. The ride is very comfortable. It handles well, even in the rain. I am not getting great mileage, but at 24 MPG it is more than double then that of my Blazer. I got the Sport because the base model was a little too bare bones. The added features remote entry, cruise control, etc are worth it. Warning: Do not lose your keys. I wanted an extra key and found it cost over $100 for just a key w/no remote, something do to w/programming the key. I got one for under $10, but it only opens the doors, it will not start the engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I must say, after having my car almost a week that I love my Honda fit. We got it, because the car I had before was a 97 civic. We had a huge accident, which led us to finding a new car for me. I am an 18 year old daughter who is about to graduate out of high school as a senior and we were looking at the new and improved 09 fit. I love the way it handles as far as steering and controlling the car. Its color just screams at people. So I'm sure they will see me this time. It's very peppy as far as the engine. Don't let that little 1.5 liter engine fool you. Not only that, but I am surrounded by airbags. So I feel extremely safe. I am so glad we found this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live on the western slope of the Rockies and had to drive to Denver to get this car (inventory very limited at local dealership). Therefore, I had to drive back OVER the Rockies to get home - about 250 miles of hilly driving. While the Fit isn't going to win any drag races with its power, it handled Vail pass and hilly driving just fine. The paddle shifters were nice for downshifting on those long uphills and downhills (people who complain about the Fit shifting too often should practice using their lower gears on hills). The steering is great - nice and tight and smooth at highway speeds and very easy for slow-speed maneuvering. It's just a fun little car with lots of great features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I used this site repeatedly when deciding on which car to buy, so I feel obliged to give my opinion on a car that I contemplated for 2 years. After 3,500mi I haven't been disappointed. I am a 6'3" caterer. The car provides more usable space than my wife's Toyota Sienna. Great stereo. Turns on a dime. My first tank of gas gave me 38 mpg. Since then it has ranged from 32 to 38. I love the navigation and instrument panel. The only complaint I have is that the front end is a bit low and you need to be careful not to scrape the bottom when backing off a steep incline onto level ground. Otherwise it's been the perfect vehicle for urban/suburban driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Fit is a wonderful car. The design is fantastic. I purchased with a stick shift/manual and the drive with the stick shift versus the automatic is like night and day! Test driving with stick is what sold me on buying the Fit ultimately, instead if buying the Toytoa Matrix. My only gripes: 1) the pick -up is a little sluggish, 2) the interior has an incredible dashboard and over-all design, HOWEVER there is no "CARPET" just some strange black felty substance and they put FABRIC on the armrest portion of the doors. I also would like the option of a sunroof. Get all your accessories on EBAY and save a fortune! MY red sporty Fit is l'ulitma!!! Really FUN TO DRIVE IT IS TRUE!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is wonderful. I traded in my 96 explorer sport (thanks cash for clunkers) for the fit and its been great so far. I do have 2 problems with the fit so far however. The drivers seat needs to be able to adjust up and down in front to help out the taller folks. Second the center console for the manual trans should be figured out so I don't have to install it my self. Otherwise I am extremely happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I was looking for a small compact car, the Fit kept coming on my radar. However, I wasn't that interested because I thought the exterior look of the car was too futuristic and mini-vanish. I preferred the look of the Subaru Impreza and Hyundai Accent. After looking at similar cars in it's class, it seemed to stand out on things important to me; safety, reliability, and gas mileage. I gave in and accepted that it might not be the best looking car. I am extremely impressed with the gas mileage and interior space/comfort the car provides. I am a very calm driver and am averaging well over 40mpg on the highway. I'm only at 450 miles, but everything is great so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Sufficient room inside for a sub-compact. Good fit for 3 adults, tight fit for 4. Decent fuel economy: 36 mpg avg on suburban/highway driving. Auto trans on Sport lacks power once it engages 5th gear. To get some power, I had to frequently force downshift using paddle shifter or pushing down on gas. You have to semi-floor it to match the speed with other cars from standing start. Ride quality is way too bone-jarring-BOUNCY on concrete surface highway, but okay on asphalt surface. I almost got sick first time I took it out on the concrete highway. Using "S" mode, it's fun to drive. It handles curves and corners great, but the paddle shifter sometimes makes harsh shift to next gear up/down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The magic rear seats are ideal for cargo. I carried over 500 pounds of water softener salt and drinking water without trouble. Ipod/USB interface works great, but speakers are so so. Combined fog light + low beam illuminates the night road well. I like large side mirrors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I currently own this car for 9 months, about 7K miles on it. We bought it for my wife so she picked the color tidewater blue (see so many of those around my area now). It's always a competition who gets the keys first! It's very spirited car for a small engine that can hold on its own on a free way. I had to bring it to the shop once because of loose plastic under dashboard that was causing rattle. It handled well two of us and about 400Lb load of mulch and soil bags. Gas meter is off by much - when I had it 36mpg on it manual calculation at a pump showed actual 29mpg so I guess official numbers (27city/33hgw) are correct.

<TEXT>I thought I would submit this review after putting about 8,000 miles on my Fit Sport Manual. Mileage during the first 7 months of ownership is averaging 37mpg (this is actual mpg, not the gauge). Power and acceleration is very good with the manual transmission. The ride is definitely harsh on the pot-holed Wisconsin roads. I still love driving this car. The seats though, are a bit too firm on the front bolster, and irritate your thighs on long rides.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far I love my Fit. It has much better throttle response and better handling than the 1999 Civic it replaced in our household. In fact, it reminds me of how much fun Hondas used to be, before they went too mainstream. It has a very useful interior, with a lot more space than you might think. The view out the front is terrific, if a little unusual. It looks like a minivan, but it drives more like a sports car, or at least a "hot hatch." Only two gripes: the ride is a bit bouncier than the Civic over rough pavement and expansion strips, and the glove box door doesn't fit quite right. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive. Good balance between fuel economy (35 mpg so far) and performance. Feels like a "real Honda," unlike the current Civic. Aggressive gearing with the stickshift means it never feels underpowered. Costs less than a Kia Soul, and rides & drives much nicer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a GREAT small car for the money. Have wanted a FIT for quite some time. Last year we needed to replace an aging minivan. Did a lot of research and fell in love with the FIT. However, it was just a tad too small for our needs as we needed the capability of transporting 6-7 in a pinch. Went with the Kia Rondo but dealer just did not want to give us fair value in trade in for the van so we decided to keep it. Well, it all worked out for the best since now we traded it in under the cash for clunkers program toward a new FIT. This car just impressed me from day 1. I love driving it. GREAT mpg, averaging 41.5 right now but I am admittedly babying it to see how much I can get. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a Honda Fit Sport with the 5 speed manual gear box and overall it's a very solid car but I traded it in for the following reasons.. The steering is way too quick and downright squirrely at highway speeds.. Around town it's not really a problem but on the highway it's annoying. You're constantly keeping the car on track. Secondly, at highway speeds it seems to be very susceptible to crosswinds because of its weight and body design. I would have to white knuckle the thing going on long trips with it. Lastly, it's geared too short. You're constantly shifting and the engine drones at highway speeds. Traded up to a civic ex coupe. I wouldn't advise buying this car at all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car feels very roomy for such a small car for both people and cargo. Average is around 37 mph overall. On trips can exceed 400 miles (10 gallons) on a tank. Steering is fast, borders on twitchy over 65 mph. Handling is excellent with rear breaking loose slightly with aggressive driving. Suspension is somewhat too stiff for bad New England roads. Acceleration more than adequate with manual trans. Front sometimes touches at end of driveways--be careful. Engine noisy over 70 mph. 65 mph is sweet spot. A/C a little weak, but doesn't sap much power. Controls work well and are easy to use.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Honda had the guts to build an almost radical design, and make it fun to drive. Bravo! It is almost as exciting to drive as my old 87 CRX SI. Quite an accomplishment. Gear ratios make good use of engine power. Hauling space is impressive. AC is plenty cool. Seats are more comfortable after broken in for a couple of months. We've had our Fit for six months, our actual mileage is 30-32 city and 36-38 highway (not what the dash shows) ours didn't get more mpg after break in, but it always exceeds EPA ratings.

<TEXT>I've owned many cars in my lifetime and this is the first time I'm compelled to write a review. First, I bought a used 2009 with 7200 miles on it saving almost $4k. I chose the Sport model because it has cruise control and paddle shifting-really fun. My last 500mile trip averaged 48.5 mpg @70 mph and that's with 3 adults and weekend luggage. Around town I'm getting between 40-43 mpg. Wish a sunroof is available but I can get by w/o it. Highway driving is very stable. The fit and finish is a definite 10. The 2009 model is far better than previous model years. I love this car - won't win any races but at 40+ mpg you can't go wrong. </TEXT>

On the flip side I get great highway miles (44mpg coming back from LA) 32-35mpg combined, smooth conservative performance (tight and quick when I need it to be), tons of space inside, more than enough room for two car seats a double stroller and a trip to COSTCO, I love the way the steering wheel feels (even more than our 135i conv.), paddle shifters are fun, and the 10 cup holders are 100% used and appreciated.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was extremely unhappy with my PT Cruiser (*ahem* PT LOSER) and did a LOT of research on the Fit and comparable vehicles. I test drove the Fit, Yaris, Cube, and Versa. I even drove the Yaris for 2 days while deciding. But after those 2 days, the decision was easy. The Fit by FAR blew the competition away. I have DOUBLED my mpg over the PT. Cargo space is amazing, and have easily fit my two large greyhounds, and last week a 6 foot industrial clothing rack. Have put 1800 miles on it in about a month. Fit also made list of greenest cars. Drove over a nail this week and the TPMS alerted me to low tire pressure. Now I look forward to driving every day, instead of wondering if my car will start! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I ADORE the real-time mpg indicator as well as the average mpg indicator. Get close to 50 mpg on highway at times(!) and a tank is averaging 32-35 mpg (when dividing it out manually). Use the cruise control every day. USB drive is fantastic. All my friends are jealous! Also like the RPM gauge. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car after my 7year old van began to cost me more and more. I was trying to stretch it a little longer while I researched this car's overall value and other's experiences. I was hooked on its looks and functions to say the least. The fuel economy is outstanding and I have cut my monthly fuel cost by 60 percent. I average about 36 driving around town. I have owned a lot of different vehicles and this car is a winner. For driving such a great little car with big features sure puts a smile on my face. My neighbors mentioned how kool it looks. I get people always asking about it. Great car with or without hybrid technology. Buy one and have fun saving $$$$.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the Fit Sport to use as a short to moderate distance economy driver and it has served very well but it took a while to warm up to the ride (very stiff). The handling is very good though and there is an amazing amount of usable space considering the vehicle dimensions. Power is adequate (with the automatic) but by no means sporty. The transmission works well and I appreciate the paddle shifter option (keeps the transmission from shifting up and down so much in hilly country when using cruise control). Front seat comfort good, visibility is outstanding. Controls are easy to use and gauges easy to read. Great city car & adequate cruiser (wind moves it around a lot on the highway).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good fuel mileage (averaging 33 with high of 43 and low of 25). 10 cup and bottle holders (very handy). The "magic" back seats are great (lets you carry tall items). Extremely maneuverable and easy to park (short turning radius). Relatively quiet. Everything works like it should.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Fit is definitely a good car, but I am suffering a serious case of buyer's remorse. I had an SUV before getting the Fit. Do your homework for sure. I did not get a good deal on it, which is part of my regrets. I think you can get a lot more car for the same price if you went with a Mazda 3 for example. I really wish I would have gotten that instead. Gas mileage is good, but the on-board gauge is off. When it says I'm getting 37 mpg, it really is around 32. Still good, but instrument is unreliable. You have to pay extra for many features that are standard for other models. Insurance higher than on previous SUV. Check w/ your agent first.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our base fit in February and at first the mpg were okay (about 30 mpg). As we became familiar with the car and became diligent in watching the mileage bar and adjusting our style of driving we steadily over time increased our mpg. Last fill-up we got 36.5 mpg comb. city/highway. This car is like a hybrid without batteries. It is unbelievable. The only problem I see is that the mpg bar should be used only as a guide. When we got 36.5 the mpg bar said we were getting 40 mpg. On this tankful it is registering 42 mpg on the mpg bar. So we're probably getting 38-39 mpg comb. This car really should get a tax credit like hybrids it is that good. We have put on 2,300 mi.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car mpg. feature is very helpful in showing people how they can adjust their ways of driving and help your wallet and environment at the same time.

<TEXT>I had an 89 and a 97 Honda Accord before this so I'm a bit of a die-hard Honda automobile fan. I've been eying the Fit even before the new model change and I am glad I decided to get it. It's no hybrid, but I still enjoy the mpg I get from it - and it's cheaper. It's fun to drive, the Magic Seats are functional/practical, not only is the car bigger than it looks, all the windows make it feel even more spacious. It's got a great engine and the car runs great. Anyone complaining about comfort or performance needs to be reminded that this is not a sports/luxury car... it's a compact car that is great on fuel economy, looks good, fun to drive, and reliable - it's a Honda. Drive it and see...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blue illuminated gauges are very stylish, the USB plug, Magic Seats, the design, the average MPG gauge (it's addicting to try to beat it), according to the gauge, I'm averaging 42.1 mpg (I'm at 400 miles right now), there are so many different things that are great, you just have to find your own!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 2007 Mazda 3 hatch M in for the fit. I have to say I like this car much more. In every day driving this car puts a bigger smile on my face. Obviously you can't push it as hard and when passing on the highway the Mazda was far superior. Seriously though, this car just makes you smile every time you get in it. If you can drive a manual car this is so fun to shift and smooth with a little practice. The ride is smooth for a car of this class Engine noise is a bit loud at high revs, and wind noise is a slightly intrusive at highway speeds but never punishing. I forgot how fun it is to drive a small low powered car hard.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>* The manual transmission wants to be shifted and shifted often. * When driving you don't feel like you're in a sub compact. Can't believe how much room you have. * The folding seats are so easy to use * The dash is in a nice blue light with no split tier dash like the civic</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I agree with all the positives that people have included in their reviews. I look forward to driving my Fit each day. I have read many of these reviews and have been surprised that not one person, as far as I have read, has complained about the door panels where your elbow rests. If you use your elbow and lift yourself up a bit to adjust your seating position, it causes these areas to now be cracked underneath the fabric. You can't see it but you can feel it with your finger if you lightly push down on it. This has now happened to both front doors and one of the back ones. I hope it is covered under warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is amazing in many respects and disappointing in a few. It's very roomy and versatile, surprisingly comfortable, and handles outstandingly well. The performance/economy compromise is okay but only just. My city mileage is about 29 and on the highway it will get 32 to 37 depending on the speeds involved (note that this is 4-5 mpg less than the mileage meter indicates). A sixth gear would be a big help. Worst feature is the ride, which is a lot stiffer than other cars I've had and driven of about the same wheelbase and weight. A lot of the interior seems to be made of flocked cardboard; Honda evidently thinks it has a good enough quality reputation to get away with this. </TEXT>

My (mix driving on both freeway/city, highest speed is 75-80 and slowest speed is 30 plus many stops) average mile per gallon is 41.9 - Great visibility/performance/handling/space. I believe I can bring 9 or 10 more miles per gallon when the engine breakdown (mix driving). Test drove Insight 2010, Prius II, Civic Hybrid 09, Civic 09, Accord 09, Camry 09 but only felt in love with Fit 09. Just share with you all about the drive-out price as well: $18.2k (wheel lock, cargo tray, carpet floormats included). </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Honda Fit offers the utility of a mini-van, the efficiency of a subcompact, and the go-cart handling of a Mini Cooper, all in a single package. Make no mistake, compromises abound in the Fit--from its tendency to sway in a crosswind to the buzzing engine to the terrible seat fabric. But the Fit does something few cars can manage--it is both eminently practical and absolutely fun to drive. The 5-speed manual shifts smoothly and the little 1.5L engine is both willing and responsive. Handling is nimble, and the tight suspension gives you the sense that you are carving turns on the asphalt. A fantastic value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Honda Fit for a month and am still glad I got it. The Fit has good crash test results, good mileage and configurable space inside. I have went to IKEA and not worried about how I was going to get stuff in the car, put a fully assembled swivel desk chair in the back that I bought from Staples, etc. The interior finishing seems kind of cheap looking even compared to the Honda Insight. The front seat headrests do not adjust in a way that will ever be comfortable and the seats are kind of hard. There is good visibility- especially out the front window- where the expansive view is absolutely luxurious. While I got the "Sport" model, there is absolutely nothing sporty here.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wrote my first review about 6 months ago & then wrote another a month later after being extremely impressed with the fuel economy. Well, I'm still very impressed, as this car has managed to deliver 37.5 mpg consistently since my purchase. Bottom line, something is jacked with the EPA figures, because most Fit owners get much better mileage than the reported 27 city/33 hwy. I also think the car desperately needs a 6th gear, as the gear ratios are way too short. I can only imagine how much better the hwy mileage would be if there was a tall 6th gear. Plus if the ratios were more spaced it would quiet down the engine noise, as the engine spins at 4,000 rpm's at 80 mph which gets annoying fast!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car is just a blast to drive! I wake up every morning looking forward to my drive to work. I dart in and out of slow moving traffic with ease. The car has one of the quickest steering ratios in any production car (12.7:1) & great feel. The brakes work very well too (despite having rear drums).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I spent a LOT of time looking at the cars in the this category and eventually couldn't find a better deal than the Fit Sport. I was able to get one at invoice. Couldn't find the exact one I wanted because finding a Sport manual w/Nav is like looking for the Loch Ness monster. Don't bother getting any simple options from the dealer, they are priced crazy. $150 for floormats (including install charge); found them on-line for $72. I've had the car for going on 3 weeks and over all I am very pleased with it, and find I can live with the cars quirks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got my 2009 base Fit in September 2008, so have now driven it for nearly 9 months. It does everything I had hoped from great gas mileage--35 mpg in 90% suburban driving--to cargo carrying. (I have hauled an extra large size electric range, and my bike will fit in the back with both wheels still on). Mileage dropped to 32 mpg in the 20 degree temperatures of December and January but is back near 36 mpg in May. It is really fun to drive as well as cute and functional. I'm heading on a 1500-mile road trip to south Florida from Asheville next week so will report on highway mileage and trip comfort after that but everything so far is really great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since initial review almost 4 months ago, "Hissy" continues to perform flawlessly. Not even a rattle. My wife is wheelchair bound and loves the easy front passenger access and egress. The hand grip situated near the top of each door is perfect for proper seating assistance. The hatchback rear allows for perfect wheelchair placement by using a bungee cord attached to standard equipped stowage hooks to prevent rolling with the magic seats UP. You could haul enough $100 bills to bail out both Chrysler and GM with the magic seats down. This FIT is the totally stripped down, least expensive FIT made. The only add-on is mud flaps. $15K for adequately equipped reliability is a bargain!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Good: My wife has always wanted a small car but with a family we had to have bigger ones. Now that the kids are gone, she got a Fit and loves it. I fit well in it at 6'4". It's like driving a go-cart. The Bad: 1. No low washer fluid light. It's only offered on Canadian models. Why?? 2. Speedometer extremely hard to read. Dark red needle on a black background. I have to take my eyes off the road for a long time to determine my speed instead of just a glance. It should be yellow or white or orange. 3. The Honda OwnerLink website should have a feedback link so owners can make suggestions. Other than that, it's a great little car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the car - or DID, until the repairs started coming up. Fog Lights have zero protection - BOTH were broken by stones at 15k miles, at $180 EACH to replace. At 22,685 miles, I'm stuck with a $900 A/C condenser replacement, caused by "road debris," not covered under warranty. A little Internet research shows this is a very common problem caused by defective design - huge holes in the lower grille allow large stones or debris to pass through, and the low clearance makes the condenser extremely vulnerable to damage. Honda should issue a recall to deal with the problem. Instead, they deny there is a problem, sticking their customers with the expense. Unfortunate - my last Honda.</TEXT>

The TDI engine is solid, no doubt. It's the rest of the car that STILL makes me nervous. Plus, I've always been a Honda guy, and after my last two Civic both went 200,000 miles without a single issue (and I do mean, none) other than air filters, oil changes, and tires, I have no reason to believe that this particular car will be any different.

<TEXT>I am loving this car so far. Averaging 37MPG on my daily 50 mile RT commute and over 39MPG on 250 mile road trip. I have grown to really like the paddle shifters in manual mode, and this from a "die-hard" manual shifter. For a sub- compact there is tons of room and think the rear seat flexibility is very well designed and functional. I find the highway ride a bit harsh and noisy, especially over expansion joints. But overall, this rates as one of the top 3 cars I have owned and I have owned nearly forty cars!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the Fit for a little over 6 months. It has been fantastic. I still get in the car and am amazed by how much value you get for about $18,000 with taxes, lic, and registration. It would be cool to have a hybrid, but we still get about 38mpg on the highway and 30mpg in the city. This is in hilly San Francisco too. You can park anywhere and still have the cargo capacity of an SUV. Basically, there is no good reason to not buy this car. Do it. You will be super happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I ordered this car in light blue color as my wife wanted and in about 2 months we got call to get it. As we looked for her new car and decided to go with subcompact for her relatively long daily commute our options were Nissan Versa or Sentra, Toyota Yaris and Honda Fit. We test drove all of them and overall impression was that Fit was better. It came with the higher price but we went for it anyway, never were sorry. Plenty of space (drove a really tall friend with his bike inside), baby in car seat has all the view, nice touch and feel. We did go to dealership recently to fix loose panel under dashboard to stop the rattle. Seems fuel gauge is not accurate. </TEXT>
