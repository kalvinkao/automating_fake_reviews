<TEXT>We bought this car in November,2008. We took it to Woodstock, Maine in the worst of weather with 5 adults and winter clothes, skis and such. We went to Niagra for the newyears fireworks show after skiing. Then we came home. We got 23.4 worst and 24.3 was our best milage. We drove it to Cape Cod to see the whales this spring. We got about the same milage. We had 5 adults and bagage for 10 days. My Wife and I took it to Moab, Utah and had a great time. We got 24.7 MPG on that trip. Only two people. I can't find anything I don't like about the car. You will not believe the power the V6 has! </TEXT>

<TEXT>At first we thought the vehicle was great but as time goes on I noticed that the ride was alot harder than my previous Jeeps. I know everybody raves about the smooth ride but I can't get used to the hard ride in this vehicle. Also there is a rattle coming from the steering wheel when going over bumps, I think it is the horn button. Overall it is a good car and except for the hard ride and the rattle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Within 1500 miles of driving off the lot, our Flex started making a high pitch sound out of the back of the car. It can be heard about 30 ft away and recently has grown loud enough to be heard within the car [if the radio is off]. When we took the car in to be fixed the dealer told us that it was the fuel pump. They called Ford and Ford told the dealer that the pump it is within the fuel pumps specs to make a high pitch whistle - so tough luck. As mentioned before, the whistle is growing louder, so maybe when our ears start to bleed Ford may change their mind, until then I tell everyone who asks how much we regret the purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Extremely comfortable with exception of the headrests which tilt too far forward. Easily remedied by reclining the seat slightly. I've had people ask me if they can peak inside the car because they love the outside and need to look further. Always lots of ooooooo's and ahhhhhhhh's. I've noticed I get the best gas mileage by using the setting with the display that shows when I'm driving in the most fuel efficient way. I drive mostly in town and get around 14 mpg. My husband on the other hand who is more of a hurry- to-the-traffic light kind of driver gets around 11 mpg. Highway average seems to be around 20mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The most comfortable seats of any vehicle we tested. Love the roominess, the Sync feature for handsfree, the "standard" outlet in the back, numerous cup holders, usb port for jump drives loaded with music, the list goes on and on!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have to agree with the other reviewer, I have had my Flex 1 month and have had the windshield crack 2 times! We were only going 20 miles an hour the last time. We don't live in rocky area and we were not going fast either time. Seems like some sort of defect in the glass, I have never had this happen before. I feel like my insurance co is going to start thinking I'm doing something shady! :) When we picked the car up at the dealer the Vista Roof glass was cracked and had to be repaired so technically we are on our 3rd glass repair in a month. We love the car other than that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We love this car! We test drove the Flex and that was all it took to say "we'll buy it!" Our last car was a Toyota Avalon, but the Flex simply is a better ride. My wife and I are getting older so we wanted comfort, which the Flex excels at for both short trips around town and long trips when we visit our grandchildren 300 miles away. We use the built in Travel Link to check Live Weather Radar, Gas station prices and local movie listings! Cool! So many people have stopped us to ask about the Flex and told us they love the look! Even the 20 something bank teller at the drive through this week. Definitely a head turner with the white roof! Our friends all want to drive our car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable Interior, Incredible Ride, Sync hands free cell phone, Easy to get in and out because its low to the ground, Head turning looks, Power flip back 2nd row seats, 4 Sunroofs, 3 row seating for seven Adults.

<TEXT>We have been driving VW (she) and Audi (he) product for over 10 years now. We had our first baby and needed a lot more room for passengers (Mom & Dad, Grand-Ma & Grand-Pa plus baby),The Flex caught our eye; we loved the styling and pricing. The interior lighting is VERY cool, the seats are VERY comfortable, the cabin is quiet the AC is cold and strong. Have limited AWD with white roof / cinnamon body. I was disappointed to see the overspray of white paint when open rear hatch, no telescopic steering wheel. Overall, we think we will drive this Flex for many years, and will likely purchase another one when the time comes. Vista roof is a must. Cargo area (rear seats folded down) carpet not great</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Center console and controls - easy to use. Vista roof is very nice. Navigation with back-up camera is a must. Interchangeable interior lighting accents are fun. LOTS of cup holders and storage - well done! Courtesy lights under exterior mirrors are a life-saver.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wrote my first review 11/08 when Flex was first purchased. Flex (Ford) has made a believer of me. I am a retired automobile sales representative and sold and drove imports.(Honda,Toyota, Nissan). Without hesitation, I would put the quality, reliability and ride of Flex against any of them. I keep looking to find some small flaw, but so far-nothing have shown. I couldn't see any way the Flex could have been improved, but Ford managed to do it with the 2010 Flex. I have never in my life been so impressed with any one car. P.S. I sold and drove the imports for almost 30 years. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Size of navigation screen. Makes other ones appear to be the size of postage stamps. Outstanding 2nd row legroom. Ride is excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The all new Ford Flex is just what I have been waiting for from Ford. Ford has mad a tremendous effort to make good styling, comfort, good gas mileage, and advance technology and they achieved all of those goals with the Ford Flex. I am very satisfied with the Sync system. It makes driving and talking on the phone so easy. I was shocked to find so much leg room in the first, second, and third row. And the technology and devices are out of this world amazing. I love the sun roof(s) that are in each seat, navigation system, DVD players, refrigerator, the power outlets, rear view camera, power lifting tailgate, and the heating and cooling seats it surely makes my life a lot funner and easier.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features about the Flex are the navigation system, plug sockets, sync system, and sun roofs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So my husband went in for an oil change on his beloved Mustang a few weeks ago and I ended up with a Flex! We were looking for a new car for me as I am requiring heated seats before moving from GA to Ohio. The consumer reviews were a main selling point. Once he drove it we were sold. It does drive remarkably well. The Sirius is addicting. I am avg height & have not noticed the issue with the headrests. My first drive was going through mountains from KY to GA. I hate driving downhill but felt way more comfortable than in my previous SUV. This week I had to drive home through flooding rain and the car handled as if the roads were dry. People at work stop me to compliment the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The drive, Sirius.Red paint. Multiple temp controls. Rear door is very easy to handle. Info center on dash. Tons of space in 2nd row</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded an 2007 Ford Edge in on an 2009 Ford Flex. I'll be honest, I'm still unsure about the exterior appearance and have taken a lot of ribbing about it being a "midget hearse" but you don't ride on the outside and the interior is awesome.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It came down to the Highlander and the Flex. We went with the Flex Limited with the 2nd row bench loaded with everything except for the vista moon roof and couldn't be any happier. For the same price of a Highlander Sport, you can get a top of the line Flex with all the bells and whistles. The car breaks necks everywhere you go and people are constantly asking me questions about it. I never thought I'd ever buy a domestic car, but Ford made me a believer with the excellent quality and styling they used on the Flex. I have a 2004 Pilot and the Flex feels better, looks better, and gets the same MPG. The white roof on the dark metallic blue paint really pops. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation system is top notch, industry best. Sync and Sirius Travel link are keep me smiling. Kids love the DVD player. Best seat in the car is definitely the 2nd row; so much leg room it's unbeliveable comfy (comes with footrests too). Plenty of storage space even with 3rd row up!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased a Ford Flex as our "people mover" for a family of six. Our previous work horses were a Suburban (160K miles) and a Honda Odyssey (130K miles). I loved the Suburban, the Odyssey was adequate, but am wowed so far by the Flex. We opted for 50/50 2nd row seating. This combined with the 50/50 3rd row seating has lead to little to no arguments about who sits in back! (all seats are equally comfortable) The interior features are great. We opted for the sky lights and this really opens up the passenger seating. My wife quickly fell in love with the bluetooth/SYNC capabilities and enjoys hands free cell phone talking while driving. 4500 miles so far and no regrets. A winner! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Unique styling. It's a head turner, we gets lots of comments like: "what is this?". Riding comfort. It's a cross between your dad's Cadailac or Lincoln and your old SUV. Styling and fund to drive. The kids love it and my wife enjoy's Flexin'. Push button access to 3rd row seating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle is outstanding for the family. Second row room is uncanny. The fuel economy is excellent for such a large vehicle. I recorded 25 MPG on a road trip and averaged about 21 total MPG so far in my travels. The inside of this vehicle is so quiet, it is like driving a Lexus. I wasn't completely sold on it until I drove it. And it can tow my boat (4500 lbs) </TEXT>

<TEXT>Most people won't care about this, but there is a design flaw in the Flex. I ordered one and felt the vehicle was ideal for me in most ways. I'm very tall and the headroom and legroom are exceptional. Which is great, except for the fact that a tall person (I'm 6'7") cannot comfortably drive this vehicle! Because it lacks a telescoping steering column, even my long arms are at full extension with no bend at the elbows. This became uncomfortable even during a short drive; during a long trip it would be unbearable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good execution of Sync technology, much better design and fit/finish than previous Ford products, nice touches like large sunroof and rear refrigerator</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got our Flex. Took some time as we must have been one of only a few people that wanted the Limited AWD with middle row bench. Came out of an LR3, so we are getting way better mileage. 17-24 is great for a 7 passenger vehicle. Way quieter and a better drive than an 09 Pilot (our only other serious contender) Super comfortable, and the Sync Nav system is awesome. My only complaint - The door clearance is only 9.5 inches, so it's highly likely we'll be scraping the curb on a regular basis. To put this in perspective, my Porsche 911 has 11.5" of clearance - so I consider that a real problem that people should know about when making their buying decisions</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling. Sync with Nav and touch screen. Comfort. Quiet and stable on the freeway. Probably the nicest interior you can get in this price range, and it doesn't drive like a truck or mini van (unlike Pilot and Acadia). Overall 9.5 out of 10. You won't be dissapointed!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had our Flex for about 2 months now and find it to be one of the most satisfying cars we've ever owned. My wife's first impession was that it looked like a hearse and she wanted nothing to do with it. Once she sat in it and drove it she liked it as much as I did. It is the most comfortable and quite car we've ever owned. Recently we were caught up in a storm outside Lubbock, TX. In particular the winds were terrible. This car was rock steady on the road with no swaying at all. Inside it was quite and relaxed. We even watched as the front move through on the doppler radar image on our navigation unit. We love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The week after we bought our solid silver Flex we took a 4,000 mile road trip. Had many chances to check fuel economy with the cruise control on and came up with these numbers: 80 mph - 23 mpg; 70 mph - 24 mpg; 60 mph - 28+ mpg. Very pleased! The ride is really comfortable except (as others have noted) the head rests tilt forward. I experienced the same thing when we test drove an '09 Pilot. I talked my husband into this car - he's 6'3", I'm 5'0" and we both love driving it. Plenty of cargo space (musician hauling keyboards & amps). Can't answer as to reliability yet, but this replaces our '99 Explorer that had 175k miles on it. I don't expect anything less from the Flex</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very impressed with all aspects of my red Ford Flex SEL. It is very roomy and the quality is outstanding. My only cons on this vehicle is that I find my front seat headrests to be very uncomfortable and that the two second row captain chairs need armrests. The sync radio with bluetooth hands free cell phone features are a real plus. I can not get over how many people have asked to see my car and how many heads it turns when being driven. It is hard to believe that the dimensions on this roomy vehicle is almost identical to my 2005 Ford Freestyle. I am getting better than 20 miles to the gallon so far in mixed driving conditions.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality, interior room, large seats, Sony sync radio, hands free cell phone hook up. My wife and I are senior citizens and have difficulty in getting in and out of sedans. Ease of getting in and out of our Flex is a blessing for us. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were looking for a larger alternative to my wife's Lexus RX330. Wife wanted more upscale vehicle, but no SUV. Flex is technically not a "luxury" vehicle, it gets very close in terms of leather, materials and technology (I am referring to the "Limited" model). Interior was in quality to her Lexus RX. The use of space inside the vehicle is superb, with many functions and useful touches. The seats are extremely easy to fold down for storage. The ride is very nice (better than the Lexus RX). Suspension is soft, but firm enough for good handling. Takes corners better than any SUV, little body roll. A solid vehicle - highly recommend. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats, lots of storage. Also, this vehicle handles very well. You do not feel like you are driving such a large vehicle. In terms of handling, it is close to a Lexus SUV, and far superior to a Escalade, Mazda, or other SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So, I was sold on an Outlook or an Acadia, even though I get Ford discount through my dad's retirement. Simply put I hated the way this car looked, a cross between a hearse and a bus. My husband insisted I at least look at it, and I admit the inside and its luxurious features got me to test drive... sold! Loaded to the gills at 450/mo for a 39mo lease - the Acadia was at least 75/mo more with less features. (retiree discount helped obviously) I can't get over how I love this car (on the inside and behind the wheel) the outside, not so much. I opted for the white platinum tricoat and really like that I don't have a different color roof! Love it inside, hate it outside - you must drive it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Split 2nd row, auto fold seating, sync (although I am confused at all it does), ambient lightinf I love and the driver display panel is amazing, tailgate seating is pretty wild too (says my 16 year old) Oh and the 'jukebox' which lets me record my cds to the car itself is the best feature ever made</FAVORITE>

The SYNC system was easy to set up -- don't know how I ever lived with out it. I will never ever buy a vehicle without SYNC -- I am hooked! Industry leading technology. We are able to load up the kids, their friends and all their gear with no problems. Gas mileage so far has been averaging 23 mpg (mixture of highway and city driving)</TEXT>

<TEXT>2 years ago I dumped my GMC Suburban and purchased a Scion XB. I was always unhappy with the XB's size & amenities, but the mileage made up for it. I was considering a GMC Acadia. Then came Flex. As soon as it appeard on Yahoo I knew it was going to be mine! I now have a loaded SEL. My wife loves it, too! Finally a cool, luxury ride. Yesterday it averaged 27.9 MPG at 60MPH over a "hilly" 10 mile highway segment using the cruise control! Wow! It beats the sticker MPG, even in the city. I'm very proud of Ford!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I first saw the flex online and was intrigued by the look. My wife and I do not have a family, however we do have a big dog and are going to get at least one more. We also go on drives to the wine country with our friends and need room. I have driven a lot of Fords including my last car (Explorer) which I hated--really bad MPG, sluggish, and cheap interior. The Flex is the opposite. They are finally putting some emphasis on quality and luxury feel in this car-especially the interior. The Sync system is great, the interior (ours is black leather) is sharp and very comfortable. Many people have made comments about the car and how impressed they are</TEXT>

<TEXT>We took ownership of our limited silver loaded up Flex on July 10, 2008. My wife and I have four children 5yrs, 4yrs, 2yrs, and new born. We had to go to a third row vehicle and I was excited about the vehicle and validated the excitement once it finally hit the lot. The exterior style is superb and distinctive. The cabin is pure luxury, comfort, and functional. The drive is very relaxing and fun. This is a cruising machine built for comfort including the tight drive, cabin, interior materials, lighting, very quiet interior, and Sony surround sound is excellent. This vehicle delivers for my family. Congratuations Ford, you have just flexed your muscle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After our second child and a need for our second car seat, it was obvious we needed a larger family ride that would afford us all of the luxury, newest technical gadgetry and efficiency. After comparing several mid to full size SUF's and minivans (which my wife refused to consider) the obvious choice was the 09 Ford Flex. It has by far the best voice recognition system available, and an awesome 12 speaker sony sound system. With amenities such as supple leather seats, Sirius satellite radio, enough cargo space (when the third row is down) to carry a double stroller and 12 bags of groceries, fuel eficiency (compared to other 7 seater suv's) and eye popping looks, this is an awesome ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Sync voice command system is awesome. It was easy to set up all three of our cell phones (up to 12 can be linked) to the system and it even downloads your address book. The speaker phone is wonderful. The hidden touchpad keyless entry is awesome too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Quite possibly the best American vehicle that I've ever owned. This vehicle rides smoothly and the AWD version of the vehicle got 24.6 MPG on a long distance trip of 1300 miles. This is 2.6 MPG better than the EPA sticker. The designers of the vehicle seem to have thought of everything including a 110 V AC outlet at the back of the 1st row center console. Must order sync on the vehicle too so that you can make hands free calls (legally required in some states) and also can control your music player or thumb drive with music on it. Seats are amazingly comfortable and ride quality is better than a minivan. Buy one and you'll be impressed too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked our new Flex and we're immediately impressed. The exterior is bold and draws looks that other crossovers wish they could get. The interior is the nicest Ford has produced to date. Plenty of room in all seats even the third row and I'm 6'2". Cupholders galore with six passenger seating, great options like auto- folding second row seats ambient lighting and the colors for the exterior. Some may not like the looks of the exterior but the interior is awesome, remember you sit in the car when driving. Give this car some serious consideration in your shopping.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my dark ink blue 09 Ford Flex SEL AWD with every option except navagation ( not available on the SEL) for $29500. I love the interior room and luxury features of this vehicle. My kids love the rear refrigerator console in the back to keep their snacks and drinks from going bad. I really like the blue and camel interior that go well together. Has a good stereo system especially with cd's but bass punch is lacking. The 265 hp 3.5l V6 and six speed automatic deliver decent power and pulls from a stop. accelerator response is good and can keep your foot slightly on the pedal. The six speed shifts smoothly but when the car is floored, there is a loud roar. Overall very good vehicle</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our flex for 10+ months and are still thrilled. The ride is amazing. We have taken two vacations in this car and it is extremely comfortable. I feel very connected to the road in this car and never feel the wind as opposed to my previous 4Runner that was difficult to handle in the slightest wind. People still are stopping me and asking me about this car. Easily average 26 mpg on the highway and 18 around town. Fit, finish and performance are still flawless. I am very proud of FORD!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased car as we moved away from our family. Since have put almost 25000 miles on the car. Issues to date: Cracked passenger 'A' pillar cover, chips from the flat frontal area. Pros: -Great to drive across country. -No DVD player, but use computer w/ 110V outlet and male-to-male 3.5mm audio cord to watch movies with sound system. -Sirius is nice, but a pain to pay for. -Sync works well. -Navigation is better than anything out there. Cons: -Like driving a boat. -No telescoping steering wheel. -No cooled seats. -Gas mileage is so-so. -Luggage space with 6 persons is tight. Overall, satisfied with build quality and features. Just wish it could drive without me steering sometimes!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a Ford Windstar and as I now have 2 grandchildren, wanted a car with a bench seat for the second area so as to be able to accommodate the child seats as well as accommodate the parents.

<TEXT>We bought the Flex after our Dodge Nitro was returned as a lemon. The Flex, which cost us about 3k more than the Nitro, is so much nicer I cannot put it into words. The ride is ultra quiet and interior feels very upscale. We test drove the Acadia, Traverse, Pilot and Highlander and the Flex stood out. Gas mileage on an all highway trip was 26mpg+. Averaging 19+ around town. Telescoping steering wheel would have been nice, but I can adjust the seat to accomodate (6'2"). 2nd row is huge. Love this car, I would definitely recommend.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As a family of 5 and needing to replace our Honda mini-van, we drove everything we could think of. The Flex won based on the fact it didn't drive like anything else we tested. The vehicle rides great, gets decent fuel econ (18c / 23h), and has tons of room. It doesn't handle like a large vehicle which is why it is becoming the favorite car to drive even when we don't have the kids with us. The headrests and non-telescopic steering haven't bothered me like other owners (5' 10" tall) and I find this to be one of the most comfortable cars we have ever owned. The Sync system is outstanding but I'm still learning some of the features. www.syncmyride.com has updates and useful info for owners.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync, vista roof, family DVD, HID headlights, quality interior materials, sweet sound system, ride / handling, NVH, doesn't look or drive like our Honda mini-van (hated it), kids love the ambient lighting.

<TEXT> My first new car in many years. Ford has raised the bar. This big safe car does many things well. It is smooth and quiet, with good acceleration. I wish it had a telescoping wheel, because at 6' 4", I can move the seat back so far that the steering wheel is almost out of reach. I like the ease of folding the back seats down. It has a ton of room with them folded (not a minivan though) I added a back-up camera/gps system to my SE and it really helps backing up. Tall seats hold you in, make turning around to see difficult for me; comfortable though. Solid highway drive. Don't drive with windows open;overpressure will drive you nuts. Mileage c. 20 in town, 25 hwy. Not great, but pretty good.</TEXT>

I'm glad I found the Flex. Styling is so much cooler and Sync and Audio is high tech. Two tone & Vista roof was a must. You can't really appreciate vehicle until you climb in. Interior is excellent quality & design. Middle row leg room is excellent. As Ford says DRIVE ONE. I drove the FLEX 1st and was so impressed. I never got around to the Toyota or Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had it about 1 month just finished a long trip down to Iowa and back. Here are my thoughts. Pros: Enormous amount of interior room esp for legs and head at all sitting positions. Boys love the ability to sit in diff places comfortably. AWD worked flawlessly in driving thunderstorm on highway. MPG better than expected ~23MPG @ 75mp. Rides and steers nicely. Have towed a popup camper and gear with no problems using factory tow package. Concerns: Needs telescoping steering wheel, adjustable headrests - no excuse Ford! Finding a comfortable driver's position can take time. Cannot buy a standard roof rack w/o factory rails. Door skins curve under car, probs w/paint chipping on gravel?</TEXT>

<TEXT>We needed a car for 3 kids and two adults. I did a lot of reading into crash tests -- not just the stars ratings, but the detailed crash test reports. 1. This is about the safest vehicle on the market. Don't overlook that it's heavy -- crash tests are about running into a car your size. Running into a heavier car is like a higher speed collision (to the lighter car). 2. Some complaints around the web are about MPG. There's no alternative noticeably better in this weight class/size. Most are worse. 3. Another con often mentioned is price. Flexes are quite reasonable right now. Ours was 22% below MSRP (after 3K rebate), and just under 6% below invoice, with virtually no haggling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety; really quiet inside (there's a zen-like tranquility driving, at least without kids aboard); reasonably responsive; affordable. Doesn't look, sound, or drive like a minivan. My wife thinks it rides better than our 2004 XC70. USB drive music in and car diagnostic info out, via Sync.</FAVORITE>

Check under your hood there is electrical tape wrapped around a piece that covers the wiring harness, it is located by the battery.

<TEXT>We wanted to replace our minivan and still needed to seat at least 6. I looked at this car and many others and kept coming back to the Flex. It grows on you quickly. Two months later and 5,000 miles already - I love it. I have had at least 6 strangers stop and look and ask me about it. Never had that happen with any other new car! I like that it is different than the usual common, boring SUVs, crossovers, and sedans. Tons of interior room for family. I am 6'-5" and this is the only car I have owned where the driver's seat is not all the way back. The boxy style helps with the engine compartment and the maintenance points (oil, battery, filters) are easily accessible.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, fun to drive, handles great, and has no trouble accelerating with the best of the them. Also like the Sync system (didn't think I would use it but do all the time now), four wheel auto anti-skid and anti-roll, rear backup warning, and thoughtful media control features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was our first family new car, ever. We looked at a bunch of models with similar features but Ford turned out to best suit our needs and budget. The salesman was great which was a huge added bonus. We opted for the SEL with AWD, DVD, Sync, and Lighting and Convienience package. Haven't done much with the sync but the bluetooth feature was easy to set up and calls on the cell were easy and clear. I would agree the headrest angle is a bit much and having a telescopic wheel would be nice, however with so many adjustments to seating this is easily overcome. It drives like it's on rails, and very smooth and quiet with enough feel of the road to help the driver. Very first class feel.</TEXT>

Dealer had it for 4 days and could not find anything wrong. Reset the light & gave it back.

<TEXT>We were looking for a car with more space and comfort than my wife's Toyota Corolla. Which we traded on the Flex. We own a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4WD. We love it but, the Flex has way more space and comfort. We took a 325 mile trip with it straight from the dealership. 24 MPG as long as you keep it at 2000 RPM's or less. The sound system is super. The driver seat in the SEL is more comfortable than my recliner! We went to our sons house and the five of us went out to eat. They were equally impressed with the comfort and space in the Flex. The cabin is well laid out. Dual climate controls are nice. It is as advertised by Ford. If you are looking for space, comfort and fair MPG buy one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Even if the Flex's "love it or hate it" looks don't appeal, its superior fit and finish, material quality, and carefully thoughtful design certainly should. And if its tremendous utility doesn't make a compelling-enough case, it's comfort certainly will. Ford took a chance with the Flex, making tremendous investments in quality throughout, and it shows. Its styling may not suit everyone's taste, but everything else about it should. Ford has engineered the kind of "German" solidity rarely found in American vehicles, and doors close with a rassuring "Shunk!" The Flex simply feels both solid and refined, and the Limited trim meets any reasonable standards for luxury that exist. Kudos to Ford.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Flex's best feature is its overall thoughtfulness. Nothing is frivolous, and the designers took obvious care to ensure nothing was "left out". All 3 rows are perfectly usable. It is simply a very well-designed, well-built vehicle whose comfort equals its other tremendous traits.</FAVORITE>

I was a GM guy through the first 25 years of my driving life and had an very bad lemon experience with a GM Truck. The GM service manager actually told me that if I wanted a real truck I needed to go to the "Blue Oval". Went to Ford in 2000 and never looked back. We were looking for a replacment for my wife's 92 Astro Van. I stopped by the Dealership and though the Flex was just awesome. I really though she would think I had lost my mind to think she would drive it. The rest is history. Bought one and really like it!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went from a GM minivan to this Flex. What a difference! Not that I didn't like my old Montana Van. It was just that my mechanic had it more than me! The first time I seen a Flex I laughed and thought what a weird looking car! Then I sat in it.... I knew then I was going to have to find something terribly wrong with it to convince myself that it wasn't the one to buy. So I took it for a test drive. Fortunately I was able to take it overnight to test the headlights out too. I do alot of night driving and the headlights are very important for me. To make a long story short, I tested over 11 crossovers/suv's from 4 manufacturers, and the Flex's ride, fit and finish, and style was the best!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although I still drive my 96 Windstar daily for work (229,000 miles) the Flex is for weekend and pleasure use for now. Ford has outdone themselves and can compete with the imports with the Flex. The ride is exceptional and the interior room is huge. I am averaging about 25.5 mpg on the road. I do not live in a congested area so gas mileage should be good for me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall handling, the sound system and the vista roof are favorites along with the lighting package offered.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Like others I shopped and shopped for a Vehicle primarily looked at the Acadia and similar cross overs. Finally decided on the Flex for the price and options. One major complaint is the poor quality or the paint job and body work it almost looks like the doors and side panels don't aline properly. If you look closely you can see allot of overspray and the quality of the interior carpet is horrible at best you can tell that Ford did not spend alot of time making sure that they did a quality job with the trim. Overall I love the car but would like to see Ford put a little more effort in the quality of the interior and craftsmanship.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this automobile !!! It makes me happy ! I love to look at it, I love to drive it ! My husband has never liked any of my cars, but now he fights me to drive it. It really is the most comfortable ---smooth. It feels like a real car, like they used to feel. I am short and I really appreciate the automatic lift. I do not have to jump anymore. The other real plus for me is that it looks so distinctive that I can find it right away in any parking lot. I also loved the choice of colors--different from all the others in the lot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It looks different and it is. First off the ride, quiet, smooth and a lot of power when needed. It corners fast and smooth full control. 4 kids absolutely love it gadgets and great sound system. Spacious and comfortable short or long trips. We have no complaints only praise a job well done. Thanks Ford</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Our favorite feature is the sound system. Kids ranging from 7-18 the music varies and so does the volume. The Sony system was well worth the$. Combine the sync control of the music system with 5000 songs and you get what you want when you ask for it. Great surround sound for action movies too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased this car about 10 days ago so I can't respond to all aspects. I can tell you this. I searched high and low and drove so many new and used cars and kept coming back to the Flex. I actually liked it the moment I saw it, but inside is where the real story begins. Leg room front and back is out of this world and no other car comes close unless you want a mini van. Sync is just awesome and honestly it drives great. People may stare but that's because they want to know more about it themselves. I can't comment on fuel and reliability because it's just to soon. However, if the total package is any indication this a real winner. Seriously, check this car out! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Room Room Room and of course sync and power lift gate are great. I got a higher end SEL and it has numerous features that are all very cool. Like the 10 minute radio on feature and how it cuts off when you open the driver side door.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow! What a vehicle. After shopping almost 12 months for a new vehicle I chose the Flex. Other alternatives were a used 2007 Cadillac SRX, the Buick Enclave, the Honda Pilot, and the Toyota Highlander. The Flex was the best vehicle. It rides better, handles great, and gets great MPG for its size (I'm averaging 19 MPG City and 26 MPG on the highway!). Sync is great but Verizon (and Sprint) won't let me use the text feature. Hopefully Ford will work this out with the mobile phone dealers. The quality of the interior is impressive and even on par with the hand-crafted SRX interior. The Pilot had way too much road noise and the Highlander, compared to the Flex, felt disconnected when driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I shopped "til" I dropped looking for "THE" car on the internet. We already have a Explorer, i decieded to check out the Ford official site. I saw this 1950ish looking wagon and click on the interior and fell in love. Went to Chicago car show, saw one! Went to our Ford dearlship, sat behind the wheel, purrrr-fect. Drove it with the pedal to the metal,(and a prayer), purrr-fect. Went home told my husband, he said wait until fall. I didn't speak to him for 1 week. He took me back saw the Flex, didn't like it. Sat in it, purrr-fect! We now own a Flex!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I are expecting our third child, and with a dog in tow we needed to get a bigger vehicle than our VW Passat Wagon. We looked at the Routan but something about the Flex caught my eye. It's different, kind of a retro look with modern amenities--so basically it felt like us. So far, so good, it drives very nicely. One of the things I like best is how quiet it is, road noise isn't very present. Our kids really love it, and the automatic seat folding in the second row make it super easy for third row egress. Definitely roomy, smooth ride, SYNC is awesome, satellite radio 2 yr sub, panoramic sun roof...all in all a great experience so far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's an American car; we hadn't bought one in a while if ever and that is important to consider. Panoramic sun roof, SYNC, comfortable seats, auto folding second row, white roof gives it a Cooper Car look...unique, not a mini- van!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up a FWD Flex Limited in February. With all the incentives, I got a Flex with an MSRP of $35.5k for $28.3k. The interior is extremely comfortable, well thought out, and is great for long drives. I just took it on my first longer distance trip and it did quite well. I averaged 24.5 mpg heading from Boston to the Albany area. Overall, I would say that is pretty impressive considering the size of the vehicle. I love the overall styling of the Flex and it does garner a fair share of attention. It is very low to the ground and is great for those of us that have to load car seats in/out of it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first American Car I have ever purchased and I am tickled Flex! I traded a Toyota Sienna Mini Van & have never looked back. The only thing I thought I *might miss are the sliding doors but it turns out the Flex doors are so wide it's easy enough for the kiddos to get in and out. People stop and ask me about it wherever I go because there aren't many out there. I def think the white roof on colored body makes it! This purchase was supposed to be for my hubby and yet in the end, I won. He loves it so much that we are thinking about buying a second Flex with a few less options. There is not one thing that I don't like about this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was online as soon as I saw the first TV commercial for the Flex. Finally, they brought back the Luxury Wagon! This is not a mini-van. The owner reviews at Edmunds.com regarding the comfort, quiet, details etc. inspired a test drive and purchase. This is a wonderfully comfortable car! It is a luxury sedan with room in the back! It handles smoothly. I am impressed with everything Ford included in this package. For the past year, I had been feeling forced to look at different makes, models and styles that I didn't LOVE because it was time for a new car. So glad I held out. Love My Flex! </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Flex It in GA</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>A friend told me to try it out and it was love at first drive! Got a great deal but then the issues started - body panels out of alignment, shimmy in front end upon braking, large paint chip, brake fluid leak, Sync electronics went dead in two days - all on a car with 9 miles on it! After 3 days in the shop, all bugs have been fixed and this car can run with the best of them at a great price. Mileage higher than posted both town & highway, comfort features galore, unbelievable Sony stereo, but we too opted for a $10 cooler instead of the $730 refrigerator. When you go to the dealer to drive one, have your trade cleaned out and ready, 'cuz you won't want to leave the lot without it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We love our SE equipped with Sync and self folding 2nd row chairs. The ride is fluid and the gas mileage is reasonable for the size of the vehicle. The interior is very nice and the Sync system worked as advertised. Front and Second Row legroom is expansive and I've even sat in the third row myself. Its a little more tight but you can usefully carry around adults back there for longer stretches. The steering wheel needs to telescope for my 6'3" frame. Other than that I highly recommend reviewing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>A solid home run from Ford Motor Company. When I first saw pictures of the Flex, I didn't get it. It was polarizing. But that was the genius the designers were going for. You either loved it, or hated it. Initially I was stuck right in the middle i.e. don't love it, but don't hate it either. But the more I saw the vehicle, it started to grow on me. Then I had an opportunity to ride in one, boy did my feelings change immediately! From that point forward it was , 'I want one.' So I bought one. Turns out to be one of the best purchase decision I've ever made. What a fabulous vehicle. Don't believe me? Drive one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought 09 Flex on 1/21/09. From day one the truck was a nightmare. The truck spent more time in service than any car I driven in 24 years. The truck has a problem with its trans seals which leak. Brought it in to have it fixed only to have a worse leak. My husband had to bring it back because he said it could catch on fire. It has a problem with the brakes which make a noise and feel like something is wrong when braking. At first I was told that this is normal for a Ford but after insisting that it be rechecked. I was told to use my emergency brakes if I couldn't stop</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love at first sight? Nah, quite the opposite. But that were it starts, rather than ends. It's somewhat analogous to the smirk you received when you caught the eye of a beautiful girl, who later falls head over heels in love with you. Neither of you saw it coming. Experiencing the Flex is a discovery of why, as teenager, you wanted to get behind the wheel and drive. Why? Because it was fun! Lot's of fun. That's the Flex. Fun, fun, fun. Ford's competitive advantage in the area of electronics shines through like a stoic lighthouse in the darkest of night! There's enough technical features to satisfy even the most ardent technophile.

<TEXT>It reminded me of those "Woody" surfer wagons. It's a perfect combination of all the electronics you can want, plus cargo space. We have an infant and two Jack Russells, and sometimes pack bikes. Traded an Infiniti FX that was loaded and this was 10K less but had virtually everything the FX had, except for the V8. What it did add was space, a retro cool look, the great SYNC system. This was my first American car in 30 years and I would have to say Ford is now up there with the Japanese and Germans. The only option I laid off was the 760 dollar refrigerator, opting instead for a 5 dollar cooler. Great roof windows, too. </TEXT>

I get excited knowing there aren't that many of them on the road. We took a road trip the day after purchasing the Flex and it was so much fun discovering all the cool things the car has to offer. It is a lot of fun to drive and it's great that my husband wants to drive my car now!</TEXT>

<TEXT>In March of 2008 I bought a Mercedes CLK 350. I drove it through out the summer in Michigan and once winter hit it became a problem. I bought the Ford Flex Limited in AWD and figured I would only drive it when the weather was bad. Now I am so obsessed with this car! I have been trying to find a way to get Mercedes Benz to take that little convertible back! It even uploaded my entire address book from my cell phone onto my screen and now I have hands free calling all the time. It's the ride, it's the comfort, it's all the luxuries rolled into one.

<TEXT>My first impression was it's a mini hearse or Mini on steroids. It evokes a strong reaction which is mellowed after driving it. We like driving the Flex but it becomes painful on longer trips due to the lack of steering wheel length adjustment. Our fuel mileage ranges between 13-15 mpg which is of concern and not fully acknowledged by the dealer. The nav, audio, heater system and display is inoperative at cold temps (mid 20'sF) until the vehicle interior warms up. A repair of the rear exterior appliqu panel was required. Folding seat locks need a second adjustment to work properly. Overall we like it and hope to get the bugs fixed soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. My husband and I were Christmas shopping and stopped to test drive a Flex just for the heck of it. We had no intention of buying one. We were just very curious as it looked so different. We were immediately sold. It is so comfortable. We had a Christmas trip planned from NH to Kentucky with our 5 kids and were a little leary of making such a trip in an unfamiliar car. It turned out to be our best trip ever. The kids didn't complain once and driving it was such a pleasure. It certainly made a 27 hour trip a lot less stressful. I think this was my best Christmas present ever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first American Car (I bought Nissan and Toyota in past), so I hope the quality is better than my parent's Grand AM (ruined my view of American Cars). The Flex rides smooth, looks nice and manuavers the road well. So far I average about 23 MPG, a disappointment comming from driving a Scion XB at 28 MPG. I bought for more room and safety issues when driving from Arizona to Californa. I have to say it is impressive, but then again I like to buy the base models because I don't want to pay for repairs of the electronics if they break. I hope my Ford Flex lives up to the quality standards Ford has been claiming. If it doesn't then this will be the first and last American car I buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a very pleasant surprise from Ford. We chose after a test ride and paid $29,800 out the door. Second and third row legroom is very strong. Vehicle tracks perfectly straight on highway! Safety for rollover on an SUV has to be tops with this car, as center of gravity is lower. Can't believe how much this auto has won us over. Ford is definitely heading in the right direction. Very proud we dropped Mercedes and saved $60,000.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new Flex SEL (previously owned by George The Iceman Gervin). The bold new look is great, I love being different and the Ford Flex's design is just that. The comfort of the seats and the ah of the interior are excellent. Even though the vehicle is not that high and appears to be low to the ground, once inside the vehicle you feel like you are in a standard size SUV. The stereo system is wonderful and the hands free sync system is a great addition also. I welcome the tight turning ratio of the car, it mirrors my Volvo XC90. he ride is firm, sturdy and comfortable, a lot of fun to drive. I turn heads everywhere I go!

<TEXT>We were not completely sold on the Flex because of the boxy design. The test drive sold us within the first minute! This car is incredibly comfortable, offers outstanding build and material quality and even with AWD, still delivers a combined mpg of 19. Ford has proven that they can still build a great American car with attributes beyond the foreign offerings. At only 5 days old, someone hit our Flex while my wife was driving, she didn't even feel the impact. She only knew that someone hit her because she saw the other car (a Camry) literally bounce off the Flex. We'd drive through a hurricane in this thing!</TEXT>

Beyond all that it is very cool, incredible retro look, great sound system and well designed nav/data system. I have already had the misfortune of being in an accident, I was smashed almost head on by a VW. The other car was destroyed and I barely felt anything. I was stunned at how hard a hit this car took (the police officer was very impressed) and I was still able to (sadly) drive it to the shop.

<TEXT>Wow! I am so pleased with my new Flex. My family needs a lot of room and seating capacity. Our last vehicle was a 1994 Ford conversion van. We were looking for vehicle with better gas milage. Our van gets 12 mpg around town. We drove a lot of other SUV's and crossover's. They were all the same. I drove the Flex and was immediately impressed with the excellent layout and comfort of the interior. Ford has alot of really cool stuff like SYNC and free Sirius service for 6 months. I was suprised how much seating room the Flex has even in the third row. But the styling of the exterior makes me grin every time I look at it.

<TEXT>I will start by saying that I am a retired automobile salesman. (28 yrs) I have own many new/used cars, mostly foreign. My wife picked the Flex, I reluctantly went along with it. After an 8 week wait for our ordered Flex, it was finally here. It was well worth the wait, and I believe it will certainly change my opinion of Ford products. We ordered a FWD limited with Nav. The Nav system will do everything but cook lunch for you. The SYNC system is surprisingly simple to operate. The second row legroom is outstanding. This car, in my opinion, is a much smoother, quieter ride than the 07 Toyota Sienna we traded in. Dont know about the mpg yet, but should be as good or better than Sienna.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wonderful vehicle that keeps getting better. This vehicle is very quiet on the road especially on the highway. Speed control best I have ever used. The transmission is truly flawless. The ride is well controlled and steering precise. I have owned many high marque brands including BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, and a VW Phaeton. Ford has done a tremendous job with this vehicle. Presently averaging 23 mpg with city and highway miles. Anyone interested in a people mover/ luxury drive not so full of pomp but great fun to drive should check this vehicle out. </TEXT>
