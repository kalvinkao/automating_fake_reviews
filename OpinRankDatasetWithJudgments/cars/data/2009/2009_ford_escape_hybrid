<TEXT>This is my first SUV, but I LOVE it! It is roomy inside and has a lot of neat gadgets. The ride is smooth, although the gas engine is a little loud. The sync feature is nice, except when it doesn't understand your commands. MPG is pretty good. I've had mine for a few weeks and average 30 mpg. The faster you drive, the more it decreases. It is a bit touchy at first and takes some getting used to transitioning from gas to electric. The more I drive it, the easier it is to use the electric motor under 40 vs the gas. If you run the AC, it is difficult to get the electric motor to kick in. Overall, great car and highly recommend it! One nice thing is that maintenance is not required often. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Not much maintenance. It only requires an oil change every 10,000 miles or every 12 month. 0-40 on electric motor.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow, with a Cash-for-Clunker deal already from the dealer for $4500 (my 1991 Ford Explorer), and $958 tax credit Federal and $3,906 tax credit (yes!) Colorado, I got a great deal, so this Hybrid wasn't so expensive for us. Being a "Full Hybrid", both the Electric Motor and gas Engine drive the wheels at the same time, and usually electric-only under 40 mph unless you step on it. When coasting downhill over 40 mph, the gas engine is on, but not using gas, as the fuel injectors close. Amazinghow it all works. Great gas milage so far - 32 mpg mostly city so far and have driven less than 1,000 miles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Large wide center console for both our elbows. Smoothness of ride and a very solid car, inside and out. Like sitting high. Great radio/CD sound and dash layout. Michelin Latitude Tour tires are specially made for hybrid, giving 1 more mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love this car. In the summer we're averaging 38 mpg in city driving (with some stretches of county roads mixed in). On the highway, it's closer to 32 mpg. My major complaints are a) the engine is very noisy, and b) the Sync system from Microsoft stinks. I'll elaborate on the latter. #1 complaint: Can't set Nav system while you're driving. If we want to find an upcoming restaurant while on the freeway, I guess we need to pull over to the side of the road? The fonts are hard to read (orange on light blue??) The LCD is polarized such that when wearing polarized sunglasses it's very dim. Basically, when we use our cheap Garmin it's easy and reliable to find locations; with Sync it's frustrati</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage. Overall package is nice. Styling, color, seating, all are good. Sync radio and satellite radio are fine. It's the nav that stinks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been looking at the FEH for a while and happened to find the one I wanted a dealer nearby, so I went to check it out. Anyway two hours later I had traded in my 2004 Chevy Malibu Maxx for my new FEH. So far I have put about 8600 miles on it in the 4 months I have had the car and I love driving it. I've got a 35 mile commute from the north side of Chicago to the western suburbs (a mix of city, freeway and horrendous traffic), and I feel as though the FEH must have been designed to drive my commute. Long haul trips are a breeze as well with the sync system to entertain (or distract) during long hours behind the wheel. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the sync system and drivers cockpit layout (wish the seat had a lumbar support). Living in Illinois I love the integrated speaker phone, so that I don't have to be one of those people wearing the stupid BT earpiece.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I ordered this vehicle back in June of '08, and picked it up in October. I have to say this vehicle is a blast to drive once you learn how to coax the electric drive into action. I really like how this car can sneak up on people in electric mode and make them turn heads as you drive past them at 30-40 mph with only the sound of the wind and the tires on the ground to cue them in to the fact that there's a car nearby. So far I haven't had any reliability issues, the car delivers the promised mileage, and the features that I got on this vehicle have all been very satisfactory and helpful (Nav system, step bars, cargo rack bars). The interior design is however a bit clunky.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Nav screen and its features. The ability to use electric drive all the way up to 40mph. The adjustable driver's seat. The night lighting. The exterior design (much more muscular/beefier than the earlier FEH model years).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I ordered this vehicle back in June and finally received it January 19, seven months later. It was worth the wait. I have bought many of Ford?s trucks, thunderbirds and other models in the last 30 plus years, but this is the most fun to drive. I have about 4000 miles on this so far and by learning to hyper-mile, I have been able to get up to 35 mpg per tank, driving in the foothills of SC. The technology in this SUV is great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Two days of driving - so this is a first impression. The car is well designed inside and out. Microsoft SYNC is very impressive and I find this feature the best of all in the car. Acceleration is sluggish - but the car does fine on the highway. I'm still in the burn in stage - so the MPG is around 27 but I'm hoping it'll improve with time and driving. The car is surprisingly roomy for the over 6' driver and is accommodating for kids in the back including a car-seat. Rear cargo room is ample, but there is no cargo net, or tie-down hooks to install one. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Microsoft SYNC with voice commands, DVD player and music integration. Fuel economy On the road quietness</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had my honda fit 2008 for mpg savings after my toyota highlander. However, the gas savings on the fit werent there. I started to investigate the ford escape hybird and I was impressed. FORD is back ! I had soooo many more features with the hybird. I bought a 20009 escape hybird (pre-owned) with about 6k miles on it. Its been really good to drive the car and the gas savings are great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded in a 4WD 07 escape hybrid for a 4WD 09 hybrid--what a huge difference--the driving experience, quality and comfort much improved. The vehicle has become a class act rather than a noisy bare bones 4X4. Other improvements include a much better tuned switch from gas to electric and the mileage is better (31 average in mixed driving and it is not yet broken in).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I couldn't be happier with my new Escape Hybrid. Even during the break-in period, during which MPG is slightly less, the efficiency is stunning. As a city driver, getting 34 mpg in the city in a beautiful, luxurious, peppy SUV is a dream come true. The pick up makes it feel more like a V6 than a 4-cylinder. The interior of the Limited edition is second-to-none, and the Sync feature is incredibly convenient. The car handles wonderfully, the steering and braking are responsive (which is an improvement from 2008, where braking was somewhat problematic, I understand). Could not be happier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great power from a 2.5L engine, but when I saw rear drum brakes in a 2009 I thought I was seeing things. I wasn't. This car is under-braked. It is hard to stop in hard braking. It is also a little squirrely in handling turns, the Escape tends to wallow in mountain turns at freeway speeds. Overall a peppy car to drive around town but I find it difficult to get the electric motor to turn on at low speeds, even using a very light touch. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine accessibility, I changed the oil today and it was super easy. Oil filter is a permanent canister so you only change the filter media. A great plus is that when you unscrew the canister it is upside down and holds all the oil. Most cars dump oil everywhere when you unscrew the filter</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned the FEH for about 4 months now and driven over 7000 miles. The FEH has been a dream come true! My only complaint is the extreme drop in mileage during a cold Wisconsin winter - which is to be expected (and I've seen) with any vehicle. But overall the excitement of driving the 09 FEH is something unmatched. The AWD kicks in without any change in how the ride feels. Great handling overall for the vehicle. My wife who has a Civic loves to drive it and feels that the car is a decent size. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My first impression of our new FEH is that the technology surrounding the car is wonderful! The EV drive train, the CVT transmission, SYNC, Blue Tooth, Sirius all work together flawlessly and make the car a lot of fun to drive. It handles pretty well and for an EUV, it's even fun on a narrow winding road. Our one complaint is that the new recycled material seats are as hard as cement and will make driving long distances (one of the reasons we went with the FEH) a bit of a challenge. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I ordered my 09 Escape Hybrid back in June and just recieved it on 11/26. The inside is gorgeous (love the light blue hue) and if I ever get stranded, I can eat my seats! I love Sync and I finally can listen to Howard Stern in the mornings now on Sirrius. I drive back and fourth into Queens (31 miles from home to work and back). Right now, I've done 200 miles and the gas gauge is just now showing a half a tank..not bad! The car looks bigger; but slightly compared to my 05 EH that I traded in for this one. The hood has been flattened out to make it seem that the car is wider. The acceleration is better and I in fact go electric at 40mph or lower. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The blue hue on the speedometer, gas gauge ect. The center console with the radio and heater is sleek! The info window that shows the outside temp, heat temperature and time is nice. The body...very sexy </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Yes, the best vehicle I've purchased in my 45 years buying new and used cars. Zero defects, outstanding mileage. I think it combines the best combination of mileage, safety, capacity, and price of any vehicle in the U.S. market today. Its $3,000 income tax rebate made it a $25,600 purchase price for me plus tax and tag. Noticeable improvements over the 2008 model I test drove early in the year. You could coast for a long time between 35 and 40 mph on electric alone! Mine is still on break-in and the average mileage with AC on half of the time (Miami,FL) is 33.6 mpg. This is on a mix 50% suburban, 30% city, 20% highway; and American made to boot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very nice SUV for the money. It's comfortable, has a great ride and has some pretty neat features, too. The Sync System connects to your cell phone, Ipod, etc. and allows you to communicate with voice commands. The interior looks very good, as well. All this and the mileage is fantastic! The transition that occurs from the electric motor to the gas engine is very smooth. It's a fun vehicle to drive. Ford really did a good job.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync. Audio system sounds very good, too. Mood lighting kind of cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle is just amazing. Averaging 31.5 MPG and I drive 38 miles one way to work, about 25 miles of which is 60 MPH+ highways. I never dreamed I would see this kind of mileage in a 4wd SUV. The ride is very comfortable and smooth even on shoddy michigan roads, but it is not floaty, sloshy, or sluggish like a lot of other SUV's or larger cars can feel. Plenty of power when you step on it - like they advertise it feels like a v-6 when you need it to. I rarely push it though because I'm always concious of mileage. Feel lucky to own it despite the cost - see favorite features below.  </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, suspension, all of it. And the cost - when I sat down and figured out all the costs involved with owning and driving this vehicle it is actually cheaper than my last Grand Am GT. Buy a car and pay less than before? Go look at the price of gas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In this volatile economic world, I find it a real plus to have a motor vehicle that yields me 30-44 mpg of gasoline. This 2009 Ford Escape Hybrid Limited does that for me thus far, and is just plan fun to drive I'm still on my first tank of gas and getting to know the SYNC & NAV systems, but thus far I am really pleased. An SUV that gets me 42 mpg around town. I really like that. I will update this as my time with the SUV increases, but for now I could not be happier with my choice </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The door mounted key pad, the navigation (NAV 2) system, the cell phone interface, the hybrid system display, the SYNC system is a joy, the moonroof, the ride, the interior lighting, the leather seats, the ground clearance, the view, the security features (computer chip key), the backup sensors</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got this car about a month ago and have been thoroughly impressed so far! I went with the limited edition one and I'm very happy I did--the navigation is one of the best in the industry, not to mention to helpful fuel economy screen and Sirius information. I believe I'm on my 4th tank of gas, and my last one got 31.5 MPG overall. You can cruise to 40 MPH on electric if you don't accelerate too hard, and the Econ AC is a huge plus. One problem is the interior design--the doors are made of cheap looking plastic material that gets scuffed easily. But don't let this fool you, the car is amazing, and if you hurry you can still get a pretty nice tax credit that helps offset the hybrid premium.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior body styling, consistent MPG, moonroof, navigation, satellite radio and travel link, stereo system, very smooth ride, steering wheel audio controls, SYNC is very useful! In dash power outlet and USB mp3 player hookup</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm proud to say this is my 2nd Escape hybrid. I know it's still new. I have only had it for a couple of weeks now, but I'm impressed. I had a 2005 Escape Hybrid and to be honest this is why I now have a second one. I traded the 05 in on this one and I have been thrilled on the improvements Ford has done on this vehicle. Tha mileage is better, the ride is better, even the looks are better. I'm impressed. I think Ford has a winner with this one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride, also the gas I save. I love riding by the gas stations and not stopping. If you seem to get a steady pace going on the road even at 60 kms the engine shuts off and lets you cruise on electric.</FAVORITE>
