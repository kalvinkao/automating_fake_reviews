<TEXT> I love this vehicle. I replaced a gas guzzler, 18 mpg, with this 27+ mpg, 80% hiway use car. I towed my race car with the replaced suv, and now I am autocrossing the xb. I've finished first in every event this year, 12. I load up my overnight gear; sleeping bag, mattress, food, cooler, clothes, and helmet, and off I go. She rides smooth and quick, plenty of power.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks really cool, drives like a sports car. Room for a lot of gear. Great view of road. The brakes could not be better.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went to dealership to buy 2010 Venza.When I drove up saw the Red 6.0 Series. Told my husband that I wanted to test drive it before I ordered my Venza. Too bad for Venza that I did. Fell in love. Went in and ordered Classic Silver Metallic XB. Coolest thing I have driven. Put numerous accessories on it. Took them a wk to install them after they got it. I got leather seats, sport steering wheel, sport shift knob, door sill illumination, overhead console box, auto dimming mirror, upgraded audio system, tinted windows, floor and cargo mats, cargo cover. Sure I missed some and still not finished adding yet. Everyone loves it but not as much as me.It's a head turner.Mad in love. Everyone needs 1.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I?ve had my 09 XB for over 7 months brand new. And since day one at over 40 M/H pulls to the right. Complained to Toyota but no action was taken. I don?t like it at all, sheep car yet I paid over $19500 cash for it. Took it to another shop and was told rear left tire out of alignment but Toyota didn?t provide adjustment for the rear and NO TIE ROD?means the rear has to be shimmed or something ,, big money to do that</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this xB for about a month and a half and I'm still loving it like the first day. Many xB1 detractors decry the increased size, but I love it. The car is more comfortable than any mid-size car. It is also quite fuel efficient considering that you are still driving a box at 65-70 mph. Recently got 34 mpg on 2hr trip to OKC, quite hilly at times. My family of 5 fits quite easily on short and longish trips. The wife loves the cargo space, which is much better than the '07 Pacifica she drives around town. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything. For under 20k in dollars, this car gives you a lot. Seamless iPod integration is a plus. Stock Pioneer equipment is very nice. Safety feature set is excellent for the price. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car for its looks and special features. It is a Absolutely Red, series 6 with upgraded floor mats, fog lights, bumper protector, Nav. system standard on this one. I was looking at an xd but really liked this special addition. So long story short I love it. Had to put some black and chrome wheels on it so I spent right at 20k for it. I get about 4 more miles to the gal. city/hwy than what was on the msrp. Quality is outstanding for the price and the Toyota quality control sure shows in this car. Only drive about 4500 miles a year but some day someone is going to get a great used car. Neat Ride</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the XB but it needs some visual balance. First the single backup light needs a partner to balance the bumper. Also, annoying is the fact only one armrest is provided but at least it is for the driver. And one final" want" for my XB would be dual pipes to really make a power statement. I guess it is the old v-8 mindset that I grew up with in the 60s.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The highway ride feels great. I drive an HHR for my job and altho pleased I prefer my XB because of the better view and more space in the interior.Also I like the XB because there is not a saturation of them on the road as compared to the PT cruisers and HHRs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just finished reading a review about the Soul,Cube, and the XB. Scion is head over shoulders over the competition. I love the comfort, unlike Honda?s board covered up with fabric, when you sit on a Scion you feel like you?re on your lazyboy at home not as though you?re in some Chinese torture camp bench. Safety was a must for me, side curtain airbags, dual airbags, ABS, VSC, 4 wheel disk brakes, etc. I also love how everything is included in the pricing, none of this ?oh you wanted a steering wheel? Well that?s extra? crap. This thing is loaded. Gas mileage. The 4 speed automatic transmission has got to go and be replaced with a 5 speed. This is key for MPG. As it stands now the gas mileag</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>e is tolerable but I wouldn?t call it good. I?m getting about 24 miles to the gallon. Also, people putting mileage figures on here don?t be lazy, do the math and don?t just put up what the trip computer tells you up here!

<TEXT>This car had pretty much what I was looking for. 1. Space the back seat room is bigger than my wife 2002 Durango, 2. Good size cargo area, 3. Decent engine size/Power, and 4. Decent Mileage. I have already put 1800 miles on and enjoy driving it. It has a lot of of spunk and great turn radius. I did my research and test drove many compact cars that was in the same price range. Nothing seemed to compare to the XB. When I work from Home my wife steals it from me. The only negatives would be the arm rest, the power plug needs the key in the ignition and door console needs to be higher. overall I love the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2009 xb last year and I love it. This car is great on gas despite what the critics say, I average 28 mpg with the 5 speed manual. I needed something bigger than a car to carry my tools but still got good gas millage and was sporty. I get compliments all the time on its looks and back seat space. I want to add the trd clutch, shifter and maybe the intercooler eventually but I am really happy I bought this wagon. The cd player upgrade is a must for any die hard music lover, I got mine upgraded for free! Thanks checkerd flag Toyota. All in all this is one bad a$$ little toaster and I know it will last me for years to come.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is more a mini minivan than a urban sedan. As a 40-something couple with a toddler, this car fits us nicely. We bought this car because it met ours needs for reliability, affordable price, interior room, good power on hills, adequate gas mileage (barely), & overall value. After 4k miles and plenty of reflection, I would still buy this car, but with different options: Base car in blue, Standard radio-touch screen version is difficult to use, Upgrade suspension, C-pillar & rear net storage (have), Rear seat/cargo area cover (have), Splash guards/wheel flares (ebay), auto dim rear view mirror (far to reach), all weather floor mats, and see other stuff below. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The xB came with a nice list of standards features that s impressive to over 40 crowd but is probably expected by the under 30 buyer. Lots of room for each passenger; Great head room for loading/unloading children in car seats; Storage under rear seat; Plenty of zoom-zoom.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my xB because I needed something 'family' sized and though I wasn't too keen on it's looks, I had heard great reviews from a friend who has an earlier model. Overall, I think it's a great value, good fuel economy, great handling, lots of interior space, and the guaranteed reliability of a Toyota (of course). I think it's a great vehicle for someone with a small family or someone who wants a different kind of small suv/wagon. </TEXT>

<TEXT>No reservation with the 09 Scion I am delighted with the buy, would of love a 5 speed shift but its my work car and the reason for purchasing the car was for economic reason. The Scion has proven after three weeks of ownership a bit of a good move on my part. Economy is great, roomy, and fun to drive. The 2.4 engine make the Scion get and go, economy of the car is really see at the low speeds, the automatic trans could use an additional gear, keeping the RPMs around 1.8k when on the highway and would make the Scion that much more economic for highway use, but with a tight engine I got 315 miles on the first out of town trip. Please do not misunderstand the Scion is good on gasoline</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had my Scion XB for a week, but I just love the way it handles making turns, sitting in it is so comfortable, gas mileage is very good. It has so much room. It drives so smooth that I have to watch my speed because I don't realize that I'm going that fast. The drivers door arm rest could be a little higher but that isn't a big deal. Definitely would recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hard decision - xB or xD I bought the xB as the seat is adjustable, just not high enough. Maybe if the side mirrors weren't so big, they leave blind spots. Also I need to have the seat way forward so now window controls are hard to find and door arm rest too low. Otherwise I love the drive, ease of turning, gas mileage in town and instrument panel. Rides nice on our horrible streets too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very pleased with my xB - averaging 28+ mpg - 50/50 around town & highway driving (what is "so-so" about that?) - I'm sure it will average 30+ mpg on a long (highway) trip. Practical and fun to drive - 2.4L has plenty of pep. Interior is sparse but functional. I like the 2008+ body style - I receive a lot of compliments and there is plenty of room inside. I don't find the center mount gauges distracting and the steering wheel position is just fine. I find it interesting that "professional" reviewers generally knock the car yet actual owners love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am pleased but not ?super excited? with my Scion so far. I have just under 5K on it and have a good feel for the ride. I, HONESTLY, could use more leg room and I?m only 5'9". I find it difficult to get comfortable. The interior of my 05 Corolla has more width between the center console and the driver?s door. Sort of weird considering how big the rest of the interior is. It has nice pick up and handling. I?ve done two checks on the mileage thus far. One all around and one this past weekend for a highway trip of about 200 miles one way, 400 total. Mileage was much less that what I expected. All around was about 22 and Highway was only 24! (actually 23.5) Pretty bad if you ask me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2006 Mini Cooper for this little Limited Edition Absolutely Red Xb and I have no regrets! This car is value packed, and offers practicality at an affordable price! This edition comes with a built in navigation system that is great (equal to my Garmin), bluetooth, etc. and is a joy to drive. Previous to buying, I looked at the Honda Element, Kia Soul, Nissan Rogue, and Mini Clubman and for the value, Scion was the clear choice! The pickup is great, the interior is well thought, and the materials used are better than I would have got if I had purchased another make...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for about a month now and I've ran up about 1100 miles on it. Each time I take it out to drive I like it a little bit more and I loved it when I bought it. The xB isn't the fastest, sportiest, or most luxurious car I've owned but it's pretty fun to drive, it handles well, and it has a comfortable ride whether I've been on road trips or just cruising around town. It's a nice balance in pretty much all fronts, which is surprising for a car this cheap. Also, the folks at Scion are a pleasure to deal with. I've also noticed that a lot of people complain about the fuel economy of the xB but I've found that I've gotten between 28 to 33 mph, which isn't that bad. </TEXT>

I average about 26 miles in mixed driving and 33 miles on the highway. I added several things to it from the dealership (Sun Roof, Fog lights, Alloy wheels, Spolier, Bumper name on the back, Rear cargo deck, TRS exhause system, TRS Air Filter.) I have taken it on several long trips with no problems. I will let the seats down and carry things. This car beats The HHR, Mazda 3, and the Element, I test drove them all.</TEXT>

The car is responsive and fun to drive. To make it even more fun, I added several Toyota dealer installed products including a cold air intake, free flow exhaust, 18" wheels and performance tires. The normal good acceleration is now fantastic. Best of all, the highway mileage is now over 31 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Son-in-law an XB 18 months ago, and when we got back to Seattle decided to buy myself one. I was looking at the Honda CRV, but at 10K more I just couldn't justify the cost. Granted the CRV is a more plush car, functionally they are very similar. I wish the XB had an extra 12v outlet, but other than that it's exceeded my expectations. After 1 week of driving we are averaging 25.7mpg, MUCH better than I expected. I didn't get many of the extras (unlike my Son-in-Laws car) but I did get the rear cargo deck. Only one other thing I'd be critical of is the Pioneer Radio. It has an SSR feature that I can't quite get right? Anyway, overall a wonderful, cost effective car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As an engineer, I researched new cars for 6 months before buying. We're expecting a second child and needed more room over our Mazda Protege. The Scion xB is the best value possible! The rear seating beats EVERYTHING we looked at! Grown-ups can sit back there - no other vehicle offered this. I had a 1993 Toyota Pickup with the I4 2.4L engine and loved it - this engine has the juice when you need it! I added the cold air intake for a little more HP - at the cost of a few MPG's. We're seeing 28MPGs, but with 128+ FT^3 interior space, that's actually pretty amazing. It is a bit heavy and catches a lot of wind, but its meant more for utility, not speed. Great for small families!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Scion because I was impressed with the standard features that came on it and the interior roominess. I am over 6 feet tall and about 300 lbs, and am comfortable in the front or back seats. Car is quick and nimble to drive, but a lot of road feel. Could get better, mileage, only about 28 ave. Most disappointed after driving less than 1,000 miles (less than 2 weeks) the check engine light came on. Took it to a dealer who "fixed" it and 4 days later had the same problem. Now they are replacing the transmission. Sure, it's under warranty, but that does nothing for my time, lost work, and aggravation. Sadly disappointed at Toyota quality. Is in the shop more than my driveway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like this car a lot but I find the suspension to be a little "bouncy" for my taste. Acceleration is surprisingly good and I find it to be exceptionally maneuverable. Biggest gripe: No Daytime Running Lights, not even as an option. Lights are required in work zones here, so that's annoying. My wife is petite, so she has to use a cushion because the side mirrors are in an awkward spot in her field of view. Other than that, it's a real crowd-pleaser.

I'm a big guy and I find ingress excellent with great seating position. However, the seats are barely acceptable with limited adjustment and no lower back support. I should have paid more attention to this detail b4 purchase! Furthermore, the seating room is plentiful but the center console rubs my knee pretty hard. I may velcro on a little padding and solve this problem. Ride and handling are excellent. Car feels solid, wind noise is nil, engine is awesome.

<TEXT>You sit a little higher in the XB than you do in normal sedans. Not as high as an SUV, (back in the day I drove a Jeep Cherokee) but high enough to provide better sight lines on the road. The interior feels very roomy, and the seats are the most comfortable of all the cars I tried before purchasing the XB. The automatic transmission works well for downshifting when roads are snowy / ice covered. Could not ask for more at this price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from a 1999 Toyota Camry I can truly say that this is the perfect car for me. As a college student the flexibility, performance and gas mileage of the car were all needed. The car handles wonderfully, looks great and is extremely reliable. My previous Camry had zero problems for the entire 160,000 miles. Toyota quality is unsurpassed and is quite evident in this vehicle. My only gripe is that the ride is a little bumpy. You do feel most every bump in the road. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Talk about one fun little ride!! This car feels more like an SUV. I love the style and room that this little jewel has. You can not go wrong with the price or the gas mileage. I traded in my 4 door toyota yaris and so glad I did! The yaris is great for the money but has nothing to offer as extras like this great ride. The yaris had no power windows, locks or keyless entry and not to mention the cheap carpet in it. I bought a black 5 speed manual and had the dealership put a hot pink stripe on the side. I am a 38 year old mother of 2 teenagers who also love my car. Can't wait to add the hot pink wheels for the final touch. I am still young at heart and this car makes me feel it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the head room and the way the position of the 5 speed manual sits on the console. Love the cargo room and the fold down seats.

<TEXT>Although my fiance' is the owner of this vehicle, I drive it a heck of a lot, and I am giving serious consideration to trading my `05 tC for one of these. My family has two first-gen xBs, and while they are what put Scion on the map, and are still cool, the gen2 xB is a dramatic improvement over the first generation, albeit a little less funky-looking. The xB purists may not like it, but I do. In the Stingray Metallic color, this little wagon looks great. the only accessories ordered at delivery were fog lights, overhead console, and rear bumper applique. My fiance' traded in a 2001 Taurus for this vehicle, and she doesn't regret it. This is her first non-Ford vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ease of ingress/egress, interior space, standard VSC/traction control/full airbag complement/4-wheel ABS disc brakes with EBD, True iPod connectivity AND an AUX port, standard power everything, and a much-improved engine (158 hp even with an automatic really moves and has "manu-matic" capability).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Luv this car so far. Comfortable and I am a BIG guy. People love it after they ride in it. Don't mind the ugly aspect, I think it looks like a cool, funky hearse. I do 130 miles a day on I95. The power boost is there when I need it...30 to 70 in a couple seconds leaves those 18 wheelers in the dust! Dealer provides the 1st two checks @ 5,000 and 10,000 miles. Great room in the back when I drop the seats. It doesn't feel like a strong built car, but only time will tell. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a young son with mobility problems. Most SUV's are a challenge for him because of the step in height. The XB is easy for him to get into (mostly without assistance), and the cargo area is big enough for his foldaway wheelchair. I like the clean design of both the interior and exterior. Although, I wish the materials used in the interior were nicer and of better quality. Most interior surfaces are hard to the touch and black. I added a custom leather steering wheel cover because the standard steering wheel was rough and uncomfortable to grip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have put about 1,500 miles on my XB and feel that I have driven it enough to write a review. I have had absolutely no problems with it, so far so good. I went to the dealership after reading reviews about the XD and felt it was a little too small. I didn't particularly like the look of the XB until I drove it. I was in love! And still am. I get alot more positive comments on it than I had expected. It's fun to drive and can get up and go if you need it to. Bottom line: If you are looking for a fun, reliable car under $20K; the XB is the right car for you!</TEXT>

<TEXT>With less than 5,000 miles racked up, I like my xB more each time I drive it. I did extensive research before I bought, even considering a CRV or Rav4. But I always came back to the xB for its fuel efficiency, interior space, cargo room and price. It handles well and with 158 hp it is much more responsive than some others in its class, like the Honda Fit.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I ordered my xB with only the floor mats and an upgraded stereo. I did choose the automatic transmission for my xB. Shortly after my purchase, I had to make a 2000 mile trip. At posted speeds, the car proved very solid on the road and achieved 32 MPG on the first 300 miles of the trip. The vehicle handles well in the city, and I quickly acclimated to the awkward interior which included the center mounted gauges. The shelf in front of the steering wheel was perfect for my GPS. My kids couldn't believe I bought such an "ugly car" until they got inside. The whole family loves the spacious interior and I love the great cost of ownership and the information display. Quite a bargain at 18K. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the onboard information display. I can monitor fuel economy and quickly determine how soon I may need to fill up on a trip.

<TEXT>The XB is the greatest. Great for large people both in the front and rear seats. 27-29 mpg on a regular basis. Easily cruises at 80+ mph on the open highway. Fun to drive. Also have a Porsche Boxster and would have to say I enjoy the XB more-makes my wife happy. The only negatives that I have are, like everyone else, is the armrest and mostly the lack of electrical outlets for cell phones, gps etc. This is really a stylish great car with great performance at a more than fair price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm just in love with this vehicle. I traded in an '07 Nissan Altima which I absolutely hated and I'm so happy I did. There is not one thing I dislike about this car. It's so roomy but still small and incredibly fun to drive. I love how you sit up in it and can see out of it so well like an SUV. It's very peppy with the 2.4L engine and it handles perfectly. I have the Stingray color and it is just beautiful. I adore the styling of this car...it's so cute! This is an awesome ride for truly anyone. I'm a 25 year old girl on the go and it does everything I want it to. Test drive one of these and you will understand why this car rocks. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gets good gas mileage, peppy, roomy, good stereo, comfortable interior and traction control. I love the digital speedometer and the fact that you can haul a quite a bit of stuff with the seats folded down. The resale value with it being a toyota is a huge plus also!</FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>Price, fuel economy (got 30.9 miles per on a recent trip), storage capacity. I also like the way the xB handles on the highway (much better than my Tribute). Great acceleration for a 4 cyl. The standard stereo is wonderful. Overhead console is a nice addition for storage.</FAVORITE>

This is my everyday driver to work 100 miles round to NYC, and my toy box on the weekend. Easy to buy without the BS. Very fun to drive. I added a TRD cold air intake and it gets up and goes better then my Hemi Magnum! I have a Thule roof rack for my 17' kayak and bike at the same time. Love it or hate it the Xb is a lot for little money, and gets noticed more and I get more questions then cars I have spent 3 times the amount on. Not the car for you if you like to hide.

Sticker was 20k included upgraded radio tint and fog lights. I had the dealer add trd air intake, lowering springs, grill, rear wind deflector, cargo box. It rides well with near 50/50 weight transfer with very little body roll. Floor it and it sounds like a turbo. The ride is quick for a 167.3 inch ride.

My 3 kids (7,5,1) fit in the back seat with car seats. Only the Van has done that..and the GP but with denting the interior armrests. Has tether point for all back seats (lower & Upper). Tons of Trunk space. Every Safety feature, trac control, stability control, brake assist, anti-lock, 6 Airbags (that alone is worth half the value of the XB). A very powerful 4-cyl while being very fuel efficient! Getting 30 mpg avg. Head-turning style. Great ride. Fun to drive. GREAT resale value!</TEXT>

This purchase made economic sense and I recommend it as it averaging about 27-28 MPG. One of the easiest cars to get in and out of, very roomy inside. Lots of standard feature for the low price. I just can't say enough good things about it.

He is a Porsche man and I have driven a BMW for 22 yrs. we both think it is a great car and feel it will be a no hassle vehicle. Great dealership...really took care of us without the pushiness.

<TEXT>I've had my xB for 4 days now. The hardest thing about buying one was deciding between Stingray Metallic and Black. I chose Black because I figured Black would always be in style. It actually has a metallic gray look to it, which really sets it off. This car is so much fun to drive. It's quick, agile, and very responsive. Even with the A/C on, I can merge onto the expressway with no problem. The ride is comfortable, although my wife prefers the cushier seats in her Lexus. There is very little road or engine noise. The stock radio/CD player sounds great. We have 4 Toyotas in the family, and this one certainly does not disappoint. It has the same build quality as the others.</TEXT>

Very good pick-up and has the go power when needed, a little bit bumpy ride but is tolerable, a little road noise but again is tolerable. My wife drove the XB for 4 days When I was out of town, she said she had more fun driving it then her new Toyota Avalon. told me that I could drive her car all the time. She loved the XB. . My Wife loves the interior and the extra leg room in the back, and My grand kids, think its a cool car over all. I did test drive other small cars , the Scion Xb won hands down. </TEXT>

I have been amazed at how much fun this car is to drive. It handles like a go-cart after driving an SUV for years. The power is great, much quicker than the SUV. Plus you can put it in manual shift and downshift for passing power. With the seats folder down i have put two 80 lbs. Dobermans in the back with plenty of room. The interior is very nice with comfortable seats and a great stereo. There are more standard features than in any other car I drove. The iPod connection is great with controls on the steering wheel.

<TEXT>The XB did a huge change in 08 with changing the look, They did well! I could not see myself driving an older XB but as soon as I saw the XB 5.0S I wanted one, I went back the next day when the dealership was open and they sold it 1hr before I got there, So I just got a base model, granted not the Gold rush color the pearl black is cool! I will add all the options like the 5.0S, but i am very happy with my purchase. I had a 03 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally edition that was very reliable. I went to buy another lancer, but ran into the XB which didn't have as many options as the Lancer GTS but the quality and resale are probably better, best of all it was cheaper!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted something affordable, roomy, and unique. The Xb fits the bill. I really enjoy the ride, the look, the decent power, great sound system that syncs seamlessly with my iphone or ipod and the great ergonomics. I managed to "pimp" my Xb from the $17g starting price to $23g with options, tax, title, blah blah blah. Added the the 19"TRD rims/wheels, dealer installed power sunroof, spoiler, fog lights, XM radio to my black box and she's a looker!! Word to the wise: I lost about 5 mpg by upgrading to those rims/tires, they look AMAZING, but definitely cost you in mpg and ride quality on crappy pavement. Overall, the absolute best for my $. Salesperson and dealer have been top notch.</TEXT>

I purchased the floor mats, sport steering wheel, upgraded pioneer head unit and rear bumper appliqu. The sound system is great for stock. Although it's not recommended, some people do light towing with their xB's (such as one Waverunner or one ATV). Visibility is quite good. Windows are large and you have a great view of everything.

<TEXT>I bought the xB as I was looking to upsize (2 growing kids) from a Nissan Sentra. I looked at the Dodge Caliber, Chevy HHR, Hyundai Sonata, and Volkswagen Jetta. Not only did the xB beat all of them on price and options, but it is a wonderfully fun yet practical car. The fit and finish were excellent. Standard options were unmatched. But the space , the inside is cavernous. The back seat passengers (my kids) have more room than I have seen in most SUVs, let alone cars. It has excellent power and pickup, even with the a/c on full blast. Even if you end up buying something else, this is a car you owe it to yourself to at least check out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just had the car for 3 days and I really enjoy driving it. After months of searching for a new vehicle my husband and I finally decided on a new xB. The price and being made by Toyota is what sold us. We got the fog lamps, rear fin, upgraded wheels, in the new stingray metal. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The inside is big enough for a family of 3 or 4 with smaller children. I like where the gages are placed, you don't have to look over or through the steering wheel to view them. It is very fun to drive. I like the suv feel, but it is still a car. Exterior is super cute. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looking for a car to downsize from the family minivan. This little car caught our attention as soon as we drove onto the lot.Great looks, cool color (stingray). Test drive was impressive, roominess was impressive. Interior design is good. We have two almost teenagers, they think it is cool. Front and rear room was surprising. We didn't want anything we hit our heads on as we entered, this doesn't happen. We don't feel closed in, like the vehicle is touching us on all sides or laying on our head (our height 6' and 5'7"). Don't have to squat or fall into the seat. Seat height is good for entering and exiting. Completely satisfied so far.Owned the car one month.Kids want to "pimp" our ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style, color, interior room. Gas mileage. Dash readings are convenient. Sound system good, Ipod hookup cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had it for 2 days now and I love it. I traded in a 2006 Xb that I was very happy with as well, and I have to say it's definitely an improvement. I am very pleased with the exterior, and interior. It rides very smooth, and the electronic power steering is very responsive. It's a great vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new Pioneer Stereo and the interior. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After trying out over 20 different vehicles my husband asked me to look at a Scion XB. With our 1st visit to the 1st dealer we were sunk and it became only a matter of time before we would buy one. Then the day came that we were shown the new 2009 color, Stingray and that was it. Next day we bought it. We love the handling of the car, the roominess inside, and the sound system is terrific. The seats are quite comfortable for us. We've tinted the windows even darker, added custom chrome rims, and it's added to the overall look. For the price we feel we've gotten a wonderful vehicle that is fun to drive and meets all our requirements. We are averaging 26 mpg on city streets, not bad!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm 6'4" and this is a perfect car for me. I've been a big truck person, but I have less need for that size vehicle. I really enjoy this feisty little wagon. I have back problems, but the car's seats fit me perfectly and I can drive hundreds of miles with no pain. It is no sports car, but it is sporty and fun to drive. I have music gear I haul around frequently, so it's a great "gigging" car. My two kids dig it as well. I like the automatic, it shifts just when I think it should and compliments the torquey 2.4 L well. The sound system is decent too, supporting 3 digital music formats on CD, plus a cool iPod interface. For the money, it's hard to beat. Toyota did good with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 06 Element. I drove that car for 1.75 years. I hate the suicide doors and the road noise. I went to Scion for a giggle to see if I could get a decent deal on XB well I did. I test drove it and fell in love with instantly. I have had it for about two weeks now. I absolutely love this little car. I drives like a dream, has 4 doors and is quite unlike the Element. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the comfort of the seats. I think the display and radio are great. It drives like a dream. My wife wants one now. If we wouldn't lose our butt on her car I would get it in a heartbeat. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had the car for just less than a week and I am already extremely pleased with its performance. The car has a great little "pick up and go" style to it. Plenty of room on the inside and easy access for the disabled/elderly. Great car for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gread CD player and all the standard functions are great as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, I traded in my 4.7L Toyota Tundra for the Scion Xb earlier this week. I went from an average of 14.7 ml/gal to 26 ml/gal. Although the Xb is small on the road, it has a big roomy interior. Very good pick-up and go power, a little bit bumpy ride but is tolerable, a little road noise but again is tolerable. The Xb is fun to take exit ramps fast, handling curves with ease, comparable to go-cart handling, little body roll. My family loves the interior and the extra leg room in the back, and they think its a cool car over all. I did test drive many cars such as Chevy HHR, Subaru impreza & forester, Ford escape, focus, fusion, the Scion Xb won hands down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great safety features: ABS, VSC, airbags. Good gas mileage and I expect that to improve. Cool looks ext/interior. Roomy inside, handling, my dealership offers a Life Time Warranty on the powertrain!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been driving a suburban since 2001. I recently totaled the vehicle and had to purchase something new. I was looking for something with good gas mileage, smaller, not too small, lots of leg room and could still haul stuff in the back if need be. The Scion XB was the perfect solution. I absolutely love this vehicle and look forward to driving it. I haven't found anything negative about it. I added the spoiler, and leather. It's a great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle after extended research on comparable vehicles; there really is no other that offers this kind of space/efficiency for the price. On the first test drive I was smitten with the overall feel and build quality and decided to purchase then (of course no mention of this to the salesman). The car handles just like a small car, the power is much better than expected and the noise levels during driving are very low. It feels as though this is a more expensive car than the sticker indicates and that itself is very impressive. The manual transmission is silky smooth and engagement of the gears is quite accurate with a solid high quality feel. Sound system is great, buy it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We now have 250 miles on our xB(ox). Things I like include the stying, performance. I like the cruise control. Other cars I've driven will downshift and floor the gas if you hit the break and then resume cruise. Not this Toyota system. Resume = smooth return to previous speed. Things I don't like. I'm short (5'7") and hit my knees on the steering column getting in and out. Would it have broken the bank to put a second arm rest for the front passenger? Would prefer an analog speedo rather than digital. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 66 and 6'4" 280# and I was looking for a suv that I could fit in and get good gas mileage. My Scion xb 09 is great. Plenty of room and more pep than I ever thought it could have. Don't hesitate and don't listen to your grandchildren when they say "box"; they change their minds when the see it. If you are in Houston call Beth at Fred Haas Toyota in Spring; when my 95 Tahoe quit on the day we were to pick up our new xb she drove 80 miles to pick us up. Service beyond the call. Hard to find these days. We are not related or anything. Ed</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Room ( front and back ) Power ( hard to believe the pick up ). Interior ( no complaints ). It's "COOL", as the grand-kids say.</FAVORITE>
