<TEXT>Had it for 3 months. Found it to be too bouncy and noisy, especially when I go over 60mph. Engine sounds like a sewing machine when idling. Interior is very nice.Good quality. At 1500 miles, I'm ready to trade it in. Bought it to replace a Nissan Murrano but it is no match for the Murano - gonna look for a new ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first American car after many years of driving foreign. I feel very fortunate to have purchased a new vehicle during such hard times and decided to give the American car companies another chance. This is my first Jeep and so far I pretty impressed. Quality and workmanship have definitely improved but the amount of product has lessened. Metal and materials have taken a back seat to technology. One of the reasons I chose Jeep was for safety. A full frame,rear wheel drive,and superb styling brought some of the important basics back to an industry that has become "boring". Looking at other SUV's, they all looked and drove the same until I met Jeep. It's a buy recommendation for me..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, functionality, and cost. Rocky Mountain addition set it apart from others. Sound system with Sirius is great</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this off road two times, once with 200 Jeep Wranglers, 3 liberties, and a few Cherokees during a large Jeep Jamboree. First the good stuff. The Liberty Sport with its ?Trail Rated? designation impressed the heck out of many of the Wrangler Owners who could not believe we were completing the Jamboree Trail in our Stock Liberty with the skid plate and towing options. We were using the OE Goodyear Wrangler P225/75R/16 tires. Most of the Wranglers were driving between were somehow modified. We were able to easily navigate the rocky and rutted road without much difficulty although I was concerned a few times. We did christen the skid plats and put a small dent in the muffler due </TEXT>

<TEXT>The first thing I want to comment on is how misleading a lot of the "professional reviews" are for the liberty. I have bought many new vehicles over the years and this is the first new vehicle I haven't had to return to the dealer for some sort of repair or adjustment. The Jeep handles very well on the highway or back roads. I was concerned over the reviews reporting how under powered the Liberty is... this is very mis- leading, the Liberty has plenty of zip, just not the rocket that some cars are these days. Also it gets knocked for fuel mileage alot, This is a true 4X4 not to be confused with a all wheel drive system that is never really in "four wheel drive" 23mpg for true 4wd is great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4x4 drive system,mygig nav is amazing,infinity sound system is awesome to say the least, heated seats for Michigan winters, tight steering very responsive. sky slider is fun and is not noisy,</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I live in Santa Fe NM. I purchased the car this past April. Traded a truck and a sports car for this. and with an extra bank discount I got a great deal. I purchased the floor room Jeep 4x4 all black with the sky roof open... The undercoat was not painted and after 3 weeks with the Jeep everything rusted underneath. Jeep squeaks when I brake! The roof is lifting and at first I was more than in love with the fact it made not a sound but now it is a wind tunnel from hell that even the great radio SAT system wont block out! I have a color called Black Pearl? There seems to be a sun spot on the hood small but does not look finished.The biggest headache of them all is Jeep does not offer a loaner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I cant afford to put the Jeep in the shop for 3-5 days like they say they need. I have called 5 dealerships and all say the same thing. I love the Jeep please don't get me wrong. It is sharp and sharp looking. A lot of fun to cruise in and yes it handles great and goes over bumps like they never </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven many Jeeps over the years, from Grand Cherokees,Commanders and XJ Cherokees (my favorite). My fully optioned w/ sky slider roof 09 Liberty LTD is an exceptional vehicle, what the Liberty should have been when the XJ was discontinued. the ride, and handling are greatly improved over the previous iteration Liberty, plenty of room inside, fit and finish improved over even the 08 model. The exterior styling is what a Jeep should be. The Red paint is flawless and it glows in the sunlight. the sky slider roof is an awesome concept with minimal wind noise and it is watertight. All of the creature comfort options make me think of the Liberty's big brothers in terms of luxury. Fantastic</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>sky slider roof, u connect, Nav sytem, My GIG radio with all the storage for personal music, rain sensitive wipers</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We looked at the Honda, crv, to bland, and read about their transmission, and air compressor problems, drove the Liberty and found it to be a great vehicle. Bought for my 20 year old, daughter who attends college in Indiana, wanted a safe 4WD vehicle for her! The Jeep filts the bill. We bought the "Rocky Mountain edition,with the satelite radio, (awesome), and we have a free lifetime powertrain warranty. We also received free oil and filter changes for life. We got total off sticker of $5,135 off sticker. The color is Deep water Blue an option,new Jeep color, the metallic in the paint shines. Looks like it will last a long time, with powertrain warranty we are "Happy"!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior,and exterior looks, plus radio and ride,very quiet,and solid felling on the road, great fit and finish,grweat price! To many favorites to list go JEEP great vehicles Chrysler is rising with this vehicle to new heights. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been a Toyota owner for several years, and my last one (2007) Camry needed a new transmission at 8k, new rims mine were defective, I also have a 07 liberty in the family, it has been great, no rattles etc, so I went to drive an 09 liberty it was very Nice, sunroof, u-connect stereo, select trac 2 4wd, I 'm sure gas mileage won't be as good as with the car, but its an suv, not the fastest but its not a slug, take your time enjoy the drive, because it does have a Nice ride, and with incentives and discounts I got $6500 off the sticker. It has a lifetime warranty on the powertrain. Hopefully it will be as good as my other liberty in terms of reliability, go test drive one, their Nice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>sunroof, touchscreen stereo,tow package, red paint is flawless.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Impressed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>We only have 5,000 miles on it, but it's the most impressive, fun to drive vehicle my wife or I have ever owned. Jeep did a great job on every aspect of the design of this vehicle. It's comfortable, roomy, plenty of power, and great looking. The suspension is awesome - soaks up huge bumps without a hiccup or any sort of crashing noise whatsoever. The ride is spectacular on and off road. Engine and tranny are USA made.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Infinity sound system is incredible, rides like a Cadillac on bumpy roads, 4wd is seamless. Fit and finish are superior to any other vehicle I've seen.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I walked into a local dealership intent on purchasing an '08 Dodge Nitro. However, after the test drive, I found it very cheap feeling, loud, and didn't feel the price matched the product. So on the way home, we swung into the Jeep dealership and I got a look at the new Liberty. I hadn't even considered it based on previous models looking like something only a teenage girl or soccer mom could love. But looking at the '09 I couldn't believe how similar it and the Nitro seemed. And after driving it, I fell in love. It feels solid on the road, the interior is much more refined, and you get a sense of quality and reliability not found in the Nitro. And uConnect is GREAT. Test drive one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>exterior design, uConnect, ride height, fold-down front passenger seat, storage compartment under cargo floor.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is very comfortable in terms of driving, with a better chassis and suspension. Handling is also very controlled and easy for such a heavy SUV. The engine on the other hand is very slow, and the car feels like it drags even when you are flooring it. In terms of fuel economy, it is not the best either. Some exterior details are overdone, and back end looks somewhat squished (done for ground clearance) </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sky roof is pretty cool,</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>All the way around, a perfect vehicle.I have an 1hr commute each way, so comfort and low noise was important to me. My sights were set on the Commander..but the price was high. I wanted professional yet sleek and I wanted the Sky's the Limit package with an affordable payment. The Sirius/Nav touch screen plays SAT/AM/FM/CD/DVD..heated leather bucket seats, you warm up,transfer files to an internal 4GB HDD and then press UConnect and call home..it's outstanding! I am still texting my bf..which btw..when I said I was getting the Liberty he laughed at me..Well the 2009 Liberty has two Driver memory profiles which stores seat and mirror settings..guess who just entered his Driver 2 setting??</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With the LTD Premium 2 package, my fav would be the leather interior, Sirius/Nav touch screen, tight turns and easy handling. Sunroof is nice and low highway noise.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having one of the first Jeep Liberty's when they came out in '01, we decided to trade it in on a new '09 Liberty. My wife racked up just shy of 100k trouble-free miles on the first one. After considering other vehicles like the Honda CRV and Subaru Forester, I liked the Liberty the best. The new one has quite a few refinements and improvements over the old one. The vehicle has more interior room, rides better, and is quieter also. Still has the rugged 4WD drive that Jeep is noted for. It may not get the gas mileage of the CRV or Subaru, or doesn't quite have the 'car-like ride', but I didn't buy it to be a car. It's a REAL 4WD, not a cutesy wanna be. It will go through about anything.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4WD, ground clearance, towing capacity, nice interior, sunroof, good looks, solidly built.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded 98 Jeep Grand Cherokee w 150k on 09 Liberty Limited with Nav, skyslider, leather, chromes- loaded (prem pack II, Nav, roof). The Liberty is a much, much, much nicer truck- it is very close to the same size, similar power to the old 5.3l V8, with better mileage. The feature content is amazing. The Nav is easy to use and was easy to pair with cell phone. It is well stuck to the road in snow- recent travel in heavy snow has reinforced the decision as a safe and stable vehicle. They say the 09 has improved ride over 08, better seal on SkySlider roof, and the tan leather (single color) looks nice- 09 also has more leather trim inside</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Amazing content: Nav w/traffic (displays turn-by-turn on instrument panel), U-connect phone, sat radio, Ipod/USB with HD, heated (hot and medium) leather, remote start, electrochromic mirrors, automatic heat, headlamps, rain sense wipers, parksense, 18? chromes, 110V outlet, SKY SLIDER.</FAVORITE>
