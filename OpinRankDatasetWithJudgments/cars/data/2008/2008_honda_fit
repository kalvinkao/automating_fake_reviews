<TEXT>I bought brand new and now have 25k miles (lots of hwy miles the first yr). Overall, been a great little car. Haven't had any problems except a nagging dash rattle that comes and goes; very fun to drive. Tons of space for all my junk. I've crammed 3 mountain bikes along with people to ride them in it without much problem. Good stereo. Gas mileage is decent, I'm getting ~31 city, but that reflects my driving style. It has some quirks and lacks some features other modern cars have, but hey, it's an econobox. I would recommend to anyone who needs an inexpensive ride. Our first Honda, won't be the last.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great little car. Easy to camp out of, haul strollers, and lumber alike. Some of the other reviews complain about MPG, mine is great. 36 to 40 MPG in town and 45 to 50 hwy every time. We have 35,000 trouble free miles. Stock tires are worn out already but they did excellent in snow and rain! First car I have ever owned - always had trucks and vans, but I have been able to haul everything the van did, still got my old truck though! Took the car camping and got it down the same trail all the 4x4's, only non truck at the camp site, buddies stop making fun of the Fit, well they have more respect anyway. I don't like that my leg hits the cup holders, but at 6'1" I am still comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought it used - 1 year old - and have had for almost a year. Just love it. Great handling. Bought it because I can put grandma's wheelchair behind the driver's seat without having to lift the chair. But come to find out it holds more than our Honda station wagon. Great headroom. Zips up the mountains. If there is a high wind, you can definitely feel it. Just slow down. Only had routine maintenance done. No problems at all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for almost 15 months. I like the roomy interior design and the handling. I am disappointed in the in-town mileage. It averages 24 mpg. The front air dam is too low and it should come with an arm rest. The suspension is rough on uneven surfaces. The interior fabric is a lint magnet. I added film to the window for sun protection and the vinyl protective mat to rear compartment. Overall I like the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At 69,000 kilometers the small engine block went on my 2008 Honda Fit. The Honda dealer will not put in a new engine. Just replace the small block. The Sales Manager at the dealership had the same problem, and Honda again only replaced the same thing. I am worried that the top of the engine will go after the warranty is off. I am wondering if this is an ongoing problem with the fits. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 1st vehicle from any dealership. I am impressed with what Honda has done with the Fit, interior/exterior design is great, quality of products used into the making, safety, overall is a great value for what it has to offer in comparison to other rival cars for the same price. This is an economy car, therefore it lacks power, if you need performance, go for the Nissan 350z. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven many cars in my day: legend, jetta, Fiat, Saturn, Toyota, etc... My car needs a good driving dynamics and personality. This car is all of that!: ergonomical, practical, efficient, responsive, spacious, peppy, and really fun. I feel like a citizen of the world when driving. Well thought out car. Get the armrest, tint, and a rubber liner for the trunk. I was impressed with winter driving, I mean having the gas tank closer to the front makes for better weight distribution (when full) for snow grip. (not ruling on tires yet) seats are wonderful for my back. Drove 1200 miles on a trip and never had any achy joints or anything! (just tired). Got over 40 mpg going 60+ mph. Great experience.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>(Being the sport model) stereo is awesome, manual transmission, space, comfort, and performance. Getting the armrest was a really good move. Getting aftermarket parts for this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>...it gets a whole lot better. This is a very inexpensive car for a Honda, so I am not averse to fixing what I don't like. Odd driving position! I splay my knees out to the sides and use the cruise control as much as possible. I still grumble though. No dead pedal! Zeta dead pedal, HIGHLY recommended. No center armrest! I bought a pricey JDM Honda center console; inexpensive console/armrest addons are available. 22K miles so far and the car is still a pure hoot to drive, which is a big deal for me; boring cars stink. I get close to 40MPG without trying too hard. And it's still cute as a bug. I'm keeping mine!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a 160 mile round trip commute. I went from a 2007 BMW 330XI to a 2008 Honda Accord EX L to the 2008 Fit SPort M/T. While it does not provide the comfort or the sizzle of the other 2 cars, it gets the job done. Just hit 1000 miles and have averaged 40+ MPG mostly bumper to bumper highway driving. Paid $15,000 plus $1099 for 5 yr 100K ext warranty. I kept the 2008 accord and just the savings in gas pays for the fit and the insurance for it. I will be in the "black when I pay $3.90/gal (next week sometime)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2008 Fit in November 2008. I test drove several different models before selecting the Honda Fit. I studied reviews of all models for fuel economy, price, resale, and environmental impact. The Fit was my choice and is a purely fun to drive. The mileage was 29 mpg during a sever Wisconsin winter. I am now getting a average of 33 miles per gallon in a mix of highway/city driving. The flexible seats make this a work horse for me when hauling plants, boxes, and other items. Larger then you would think interior fit four comfortably. I have my MP3 player hooked up to the port and listen to that most of the time.Speaker system rocks! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Flexible seating. Speaker system. MP3 port. Sporty look and feel. Fuel economy. Size (I fit in the smallest parking spaces!) Handling and response. I internet purchased cargo floor mat and cover, rubber floor mats, bumper guard, locking gas cap which were much cheaper than at the dealership. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a commuter that was inexpensive to buy and own, good on gas, and had a big hole in the back. The Fit "fit" all of those. To my great surprise it is also a total hoot to drive. Light, quick and nimble, perfect for country roads and city streets. Also holds its own on the highway. Complaints; fairly minor, all to do with driver comfort/convenience. I added an aftermarket dead pedal and home-made driver's door armrest pad. Next is a "Genuine Honda" center console, special order from Japan because they do not offer them here (Japan gets nav and climate control too!) I'll also do map lights. 37+ MPG avg so far, mix of commuting / local jaunts. Hope ScanGauge gets me to 40 :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove a pick-up for the past 20 years. Due to high gas prices had to find something a little more gas friendly. Stumbled upon the Fit at my local dealer and thought I would give it a try. WOW, I was not disappointed and bought it the next day. Mixed driving getting 36-39 mpg. Drove 350 miles on 9.1 gals. The rear fold down seats create lots of room. Have to fold down the smaller back seat for golf clubs. Handles great!!! Honda has done it again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My criteria was simple - an economical, inexpensive, high quality vehicle that could carry a companion, a bike, a kayak, personal "stuff" and not require a small mortgage payment when I stopped for gas. The Fit is all that and more with a 5 star insurance rating and is actually fun to drive - - especially around town, or on curvy back roads. Honda has proved that "inexpensive" doesn't have to mean "cheap". This vehicle has more secret storage spots and room than many SUVs I've driven. Oh - - and did I mention 32 to 38 M.P.G.!</TEXT>

<TEXT>First decision to buy anything was a response to runaway gas prices. I immediately looked to Honda or Toyota. Honda won hands down on price and value. As a previous Honda owner , The Fit being my third I was rest assured of quality and performance. Looks are very contemporary and plain "cool". I'm 49. Function was genius. Space inside was smartly engineered. Access to it was smart. This car is tight and precise. I only have 75 miles on it yet so no mileage to report on. I am like a crack addict on withdrawal trying to keep from using all of it's power for fun performance driving until break in is over. Serious sports car like control at even moderate speeds. This car will dance on a dime. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cool euro looks. The metallic blaze orange works in all types of lighting. The car transitions well from various road conditions for decent road feel comfort. Sport type air effects trim look neat. Like the fog lights, paddle shifters, instrument cluster. Excellent sound system. Economy and handling.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>EXCELLENT VALUE!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Excellent! I will have this car for at least 300,000 miles (like my Dodge Colt from years back. 248,000 miles same engine/transmissions also 5 spd) the fit is phenomenal! First tank of gas around 37 mpg (city/hghwy combined. If you drive the speed limit meticulously as I am doing now you can easily get 39-41 mpg! The Toyota yaris is smaller and $1800 more. Base fit comes with abs, pwr doors, am/FM/single cd - 160 Watt stereo. 5 spd shifts like butter. Short throws. Rides nice. Practical yet not cheap. Great build, ,excellent brakes, steering, road manners and of course its a Honda. So I am certain it will last easy 300,000 miles (just ride it easy and change the oil every 6,000 miles</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I'm 6,1" tall. The fit has nice leg/shoulder room (not cramped), excellent brakes, steering, no road noise. In/out access is a breeze. And cleaning the hatch (back) window is so easy. Great on gas 40+ mpg if you are meticulous with the speed limit and you if you don't 'dog the car'. Treat it well!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I stumbled on the Fit completely by accident walking through the dealership looking to buy a Civic, and walked out driving it. The fold flat seats were an immediate seller for me as no trunk can hold the things the Fit can. I think I probably paid a little too much at $15,900 for the MT but I was in a time crunch. My Fit came with sweet tinted windows that I would strongly suggest to anyone, it makes the car look very unique and sporty not to mention keeping your seats from bleaching and reducing theft. I have tracked my MPG for the first 4000 miles and I?m getting 26/36. The M/T is definitely the way to go, must quicker than my A/T 127 hp ?03 Civic. I would recommend this car to anyone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I own a nice Sienna, but she was driving it over 30,000 miles a year, mostly on short errands. A ridiculous amount of wear on an expensive car and one that burns lots of gas. I bought the Fit so the Sienna would last until my kids are grown. Originally feared my wife would not take to the Fit, but both she and I like it and it now gets almost all the local miles. We drive the Sienna on trips and to church weekly to keep the engine cleaned out. The Sienna is a nicer ride, but for local trips the Fit is not only acceptable, it is much easier to park.</TEXT>

I wanted a commute car with storage capacity and I was impressed by the storage space and the fit finish and power to the car. I could have waiting for the 2008 fit but it didn't have any "must have" features. I bought this car on 5/3/08 and so far it's a great ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at everything, I decided on my fit, and I am "fit" to be tied with happiness. Mileage is excellent, in fact I just filled it up, and it took 8 gal of gas for 324 miles. Being retired, and almost 70 years of age, I can stay with almost anything on the road. It is comfortable in town and on the road. No wind noise, Cruise control works great, and since I have the "sport" model, I get compliments every day. I almost bought a Mazda 3, but then when you consider the resale value, the "fit" is the only choice. They now have some great "trick stuff" to customize your fit, and I look for excuses to drive it. Oh, I used to drive an avalanche, and loved it. It's an outstanding car, go buy one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the looks, cornering, handling, and solid build quality.It has loads of storage, although from the outside, it doesn't look like it.People are always amazed at the room inside my "Fit", and I can hide my golf clubs "under the rear seat", and still carry other people, and they have leg room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Exceeded my expectations. It's fun to drive. Interior is very quiet and feels soo much larger than exterior dimensions. Interior is also very flexible creating a large space with great height. I'm 6'2" and have tons of room (except for right foot). Now I keep my Crew Cab at home and love running around in this. My kids have plenty of room too. Stereo is great. Build quality seems exceptional. could easily make this your only car. So far averaging 31.6 mpg in all city / errand driving...exceeding my expectations.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When it came time to replace an old Caravan, I wanted something smaller and fuel efficient, yet with good, intelligent use of interior space. I considered hybrids but felt the premium paid to get this technology just wasn't worth it. All the subsequent research I did kept pointing directly to the Honda Fit. I looked at the competition, but only ended up test driving the Fit. After that I was sold on the car. So far in the first 1000 miles, we have averaged about 37.5 mpg and with full break-in I'd love to push that over 40 mpg. It gives me all the economy I was looking for and it is really fun to drive. Now I wonder if we should trade in the Grand Caravan for another?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The economy ranks first, the "fun-to- drive" factor ranks a close second. It is remarkable that it seems so big on the inside with such a small exterior volume. The base model has all the features we require. The ABS, side-curtain airbags and the excellent crash test ratings are another plus.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I finally traded my gas guzzler, SUV for a Sports Fit. After doing the research and driving the car, I purchased my orange Fit. I had to adjust to less suspension, a rougher road ride than before. I loved the quick turn action and actually entered the freeway and hit 60 mph in six seconds. It performs nicely and I came from Mercedes and Nissan Pathfinder. I love my little car, more features included than on the Matrix.

<TEXT>Honda DNA, car is fun to drive, efficient cargo utilization, good expected mileage (have not used a full tank yet). Excellent ABS brakes, turns on a dime, responsive stering, and fast. Mine is black, beautifull. My wife and I love it. Very practical, This is our 4th Honda. We also have an 05 Element EX. The only recommendation I have is that Cruise and remote keyless entry should be otions offered on the base model. All of this for less than $15 grand with auto and air and a bunch of airnags.

<TEXT>When going to the Honda Dealership I was looking into purchasing a Civic. I only wanted to spend $ 15,000.00 on a car. I noticed that I was not geeting rims, spoiler or fog lights with the Civic. The sales repp showed me the Fit and I was worried because I have never heard of it. Come to find out the Fit had better seats and better options in than the Civic. The Fit is really comfortable and sporty looking. I have been very happy with it. The 1st day I took it to work the whole office was asking who's red honda is parked out side? It's very nice. I have been able to haul stuff to the dump.

<AUTHOR>Luv My Fit</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>So it looks tiny from the outside (inside it's surprisingly roomy) , and it's kind of ugly in an endearing sort of way; but the more I drive this car the more I love it! It is the most functional, fuel efficient, and fabulously fun car I have ever owned. My step-mom has a convertible Saab and my father has a Mercedes S class. You know what? I prefer driving my Fit better than driving their gas guzzling money pits! The Fit corners like it's on rails. If you know how to properly use the paddle shifters, the car will straight out fly (because it's so light). But if you're stuck in bumper to bumper traffic, just drive it as an automatic. It's unique, easy on the wallet, and flat out fun!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I'm a disabled Veteran, and the low load floor is easy on my back when I'm loading the hatch.

<TEXT>After trading in my Mercedes 300SD and my Buick LeSabre for something more fuel efficient. I found the Fit to be exactly what I was looking for in a commuter car. It has plenty of room, more so then it looks. I did have to spend an extra $500 on accessories to finish the car. Accessories such as floor mats, wheel lock, cargo cover, bumper appliqué. The gas mileage is amazing. The first tank started at 33 MPG, the 2nd tank is at 36 MPG, the 3rd tank is up to 39.5 MPG, who know what the next tank will bring. I have to confess I have not been running the A/C since the weather is still cool. I do expect the mileage to drop a couple of MPG when I fire up the A/C. I am happy with the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 5 spd MT Sport has more than enough get up and go with the 100+ horse at under 2500 lbs. Great handling, but at a cost of firm ride. Of course, firmness lends itself to the noisy buzz at hwy speeds, but easily tolerable when taking the Avg 31 mpg on first tank into effect. And that's before engine break-in. Can't wait to see the MPG #'s with a KN typhoon system that adds +5hp at the 5-10K mile mark. Obviously, parking space is no longer an issue anywhere.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car was a big disappointment after driving it for a couple of weeks. The engine, build quality, fuel economy, and fun to drive factor were all there. However, the seating position and lack of a dead pedal left me feeling very uncomfortable. The gas pedal is too close to the driver, which resulted in constantly lifting one's foot off the accelerator in order to properly control the throttle. Move the seat back too far and you can't reach the clutch and steering wheel. Also the lack of a dead pedal (or even a flat spot), leaves one's foot on a round bump. This was such a shame because the car really zips around and is fun to drive.The new FIT is out this fall & I advise to wait.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Honda Fit was purchased for economic utility, and it serves those ends admirably. It is very well designed and, as far as I can tell at this point, very well manufactured. The interior space, when all the rear seats are folded flat, is amazing. The front seats are fr more comfortable than they look, although the upholstery seems to attract every bit of fluff in the area. It's not a vehicle that flourishes at high speeds; the engine becomes very busy and high-speed stability is not a strong point. But for the purposes cited above, I know of nothing to equal it currently available on the market. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the Fit for only 6 months and I like it more and more everyday. Gas mileage is great. There is so much cargo space for such a little car. I can fit my Mountain Bike in the back without having to break it down. Love the cargo space. Its great in the snow for such a little car. This little car has some power behind it. The ratio between the steering wheel and the pedals is a bit uncomfortable. I think a telescoping steering wheel would easily solve this.

<TEXT>I've only had my Fit Sport for a month but the word surprise keeps coming to mind. I'm a big, 6'-1" and,..eh, not dainty. This car is more comfortable than the Dakota P/U it replaces and gets twice the gas mileage. I drove from RI to NY and back with my two sisters in one day, they were both impressed with it's relative comfort over 400 miles. The Fit is fun and light on it's feet on curvy roads, like driving a go-cart. I'm a dog trainer, having space for a pet divider or dog crate is crucial; the seats fold flat in an instant to accommodate even XL crates and there's tie downs in the floor to secure them. Fit, finish, and ergonomics are all top notch at a lower cost than most hybrids.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got my 2008 Honda FIT Sport Trim with Automatic. I love every bit of it. It is stylish, fun to drive, excellent room and great gas mileage. The only things needed are power driver seat, intermittent rear windshield wiper with washer, center console, actual oil change specification, automatic headlights on at dark, Also include as standard, floor mats, rear cargo cover, and multiple 12 volt DC plugs and several 120 volt AC plugs. I highly recommend the Automatic Sport Trim FIT, you can go with the automatic or shift without touching a clutch. The AC and radio are GREAT! I also recommend the 8 year 100,000 mile extended warranty, cargo cover and extra window tinting.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Automatic with shifters, AC, Radio, gas mileage, fold-up and fold down seats, alarm system with fuel shutoff, flat windshield wipers which cover larger area and do a superior wiping job, keyless entry, deep blue color, overall style, and fun to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When we went looking for a car, we had never heard a Fit much less saw of one. After having seen one, my wife said "It looks like if got punched in the nose." Needless to say, we were less than impressed; at first. Once we saw the type of room inside, you can fit an Alpaca for God's sake, we were intrigued. After the test drive, it was time to do some online research. A week later, we drove home in our new little buddy. I parked my Mazda RX-8 in the garage and was able to pay for the Fit with gas savings alone. After 6 months, we already have 20,000+ miles on it and it still runs like a champ. The only issue was a dent received in a parking lot and a cracked windshield. We love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage by far. It is also very roomy, we packed all our wedding gifts in Michigan and drove over for 18 hours back home. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got my car last month. I've put 1000 miles on it so far and I am rather pleased. the only item i have regrets with is not having cruise control. i am getting 30-32 mpg which is double what my previous car was getting. I only wish i could have waited to take a look at the 2009 fit. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a 2000 Dodge Dakota Quad cab 4.7L V-8 for a 2008 Honda Fit 1.5L I- 4? What was I thinking? I'll tell you what I was thinking. After 3 months of research and test drives, this is simply the best car, period. It may not be as large as a Hummer or as cushy as a Caddy, but this beats just about every other car on the market in the price you pay versus standard features and gas mileage. This results in much less engine noise. After 2000 miles. I commute 50 mi each way half interstate half stop and go. I have yet to get less than 33 MPG averaging 78 on the Interstate portion. And I can still pack in 8 2x6 8ft boards. FYI... At 70 MPH the AT runs the engine 1K RPM lower than the MT.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The flappy paddle shifters on the AT give me all of the fun that I felt in the MT. Drop the stick in S and flap away. It drives and holds people and cargo like a much larger vehicle. I saved so much money in gas that I can make my payment & pay for gas and I still save money.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car runs and runs fast. You will think there is a bigger motor than the mini mill. All the Honda quality is there and not any real issues. You may have to live without a few items, but the gas pump will not make you pay. The lack of a dead pedal is not a problem either. The driving position is a bit awkward on a long road trip. It is workable however. This car is highly recommended. Keep looking and find a dealer who will work with you and don't buy from the arrogant Honda dealer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG! 36 highway and 34 in town. Not quite 2000 miles, so it should improve. Safety features are top notch too. Beautiful paint. Car runs down the road, 90 mph is easy. Motor noise is not bad. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my '04 Accord, as I needed more space and maximum mileage. The Fit hasn't disappointed. I average 36- 37 mpg in open and rush-hour driving. I've carried lots of cargo, including a 46" TV upright right behind the driver's seat. Seating configurations are great. It's easy and fun to drive, maneuver, and park. The only thing I miss from my Accord (which I loved) is the automatic temperature control.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought at 08 Fit Sport 5AT in blaze orange in Dec 07 for my 20 yr old son. Was so impressed bought same car for myself 3 weeks ago in Milano red. MPG reading on first 200 miles of driving was 33.3 in mix of city/interstate driving on 12-mile commute. I got my Fit for $50 over invoice which was hard to believe, if stories of $4/gallon gas this summer come true. There are a lot of people driving big trucks and SUVs that get 10-12 MPG in real world driving that are going to be severely impacted. Supply and demand drives the prices for goods and services and if Americans would start driving high-MPG vehicles and cut our national consumption, we would see gas prices fall by $1/gallon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After getting through a terrible ordeal with the dealership, my Honda Fit is great! I'll list my cons first: I agree with comments that there should be a center arm rest & a dead pedal next to the clutch. I also wish that the rear window wiper had an intermittent speed. There is quite a bit of road noise coming up from the floor at highway speed. On a day to day basis though, these things do not really bother me. Having used an automatic transmission Fit while waiting for my real car, I definitely recommend the manual transmission and would not even buy an automatic in this model. I love the zippiness of my Fit & the sound system is good. It is so cute, well designed & fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was excited to get the fit but disappointed when I realized it maxed out at 35 mpg. In reality I'm getting 25 mpg and I drive mostly on the HWY. I hear this will get better in time. Right now Honda is purposefully not making many Fits to drive demand. Most dealerships are charging an additional 1500 to every car because of this false demand Honda is creating. Also the Fit does not come with floor mats. When you buy them you can't just lay them down but you need to cut into the floor of the car. What were they thinking with that???!!! Overall I do like the fit. It's fun to drive and looks cool in my opinion. Its a Honda so I trust it will be reliable. Time will tell.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Inside it's a big car, drives like a little car, parks anywhere and is FUN to drive. My 6'3 husband can finally sit up in my car. Adjustable seat belts mean I don't get choked anymore. Total city driving I'm getting 27+ and a 50 50 mix I'm getting 33. The dash panel is full of information, easy to set/reset everything with good outside noise insulation (for a small car) and easy to use radio, heater, and ac while driving. Love the idea of extra cargo room and even nap time with the fold down seats. Glad I finally own a Honda! Looking forward to a long life. I'll give it 5 stars overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My decision to purchase the Fit seems smarter everyday. It gets an overall average 33 mpg, it fits all my music gear and it's fun to drive. I've had 4 adults in it comfortably and 5 adults in it for a (thankfully) short trip without complaint. It more than satisfies my needs and I get to have fun and be thrifty while I get to work, practices and errands. It handles fantastically and it feels like it feels faster than it is, which I like. Pretty decent stereo (6 speakers) and the dash is attractive and well laid out. My only complaint is the car came standard with window tinting, I guess it did because I can't see any tinting anywhere. That's just a quibble. Overall, I'd recommend it for anyone.</TEXT>

I never heard of the Fit but my son did some research. Well we bought the Fit and I must say that around town im getting 34mpg, the vehicle is worth every penny and the comfort level is superb.

<TEXT>The last time I filled my Jeep it cost me $74, and vowed the following weekend to get rid of it. I wanted a Honda Civic, but after driving that and the Fit I was hooked on the Fit! This is an amazing big car stuck in a little car body. The outside appears to be so compact yet once inside there is so much room it's unbelievable. I am happy with aspect of this car so far. The cargo capacity is huge and the comfort is what's expected of a small car, so not bad at all. The ability to maintain in traffic is there, I have no trouble with acceleration or braking; I am so pleased with the performance I sometimes forget I am driving a compact car! I would recommend to anybody with kids and pets! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I now have 5,000 miles on my Fit - all in winter. Average of all fuel use is 36 mpg. When I first started looking for a new car, I fell in love with the Fit. Looked at half a dozen probably suitable models and the Fit was the only one that affected me that way. Everything about it suited what I needed, and test drives on highway and suburban roads were FUN! Still have trouble believing such an economical car has features such as ABS brakes, cruise control, and so many safety features my insurance is no higher than for the 10-yr old car I replaced. And the car is CUTE. Still haven't gotten over how cute. Unlike some others, I like the TPMS. It's worked for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got the car a month ago. Originally read that it would be too small for me. I'm over 6 feet tall. This car is big enough for me and people taller than me with no problems. It has huge interior and cargo area. It performs like a sports car. Unlike other people reviewing this car, I have no problems with road noise at 80 mph, and can hear the radio just fine. It has a stiff suspension so on bumpy roads, these will transmit into the cockpit, but on most good roads the ride is quiet. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I test drove the Automatic but didn't like the acceleration. The Manual is much much peppier but has no neat paddle shifters on the steering wheel. The gas mileage is great. I've gotten over 40 mpg regularly. It turns on a dime, even at faster speeds.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is for anyone like me that was very hesitant to buy such a little car. I wrestled back and forth between the Civic and Mazda3 wagon. When I sold my gas guzzling truck for less than I hoped to get for it I only could afford the Fit. I've only had this a short time but I could not be happier with the Fit. This thing feels so much bigger inside then what it looks like. I find it to be a huge surprise and I'm relly digging this little thing. If you are walking the fence on this car I would suggest taking a long test drive. You may find what I found. This is a great car and Honda will have a huge hit on there hands.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First, going from a V6 to a 4 cyl engine is a huge adjustment. The blue back lit display is very easy to read. Nice large display. My biggest complaint is that the engine does not like to accelerate. Especially from a stop. Once it gets going it is ok. I recently moved and being able to fold down the back seats flat helped a lot in moving. Given the attention to safety that Honda gives, it is too bad that the ABS, traction control, and stability control are not standard features. The steering wheel does not telescope so I am having to reach and there is no center console. I have been doing mostly city driving in heavy traffic so the gas mileage is not what it was advertised to be. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold down back seats for larger cargo area. The back seats also fold up like a folding chair so a bike or other object can be placed between the front seats and the back seats. The gas milage. I can go 10-14 days without having to put any gas in the tank. With my other car it was every 5 days.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Pro: Great space utilization. Quick and direct handling. Incredibly good gear shift linkage. Good interior controls. Fairly economical (33MPH in northern winter). Adequate horsepower for my purposes. Con: Very short wheelbase yields a somewhat choppy ride. VERY firm suspension doesn't help. Lots of wind and tire noise at 75 MPH, so high that I won't use the radio above 65MPH. Geared short - 20MPH/1kRPM, which makes noise worse. Wanted to buy a set of snow tires the the tire pressure sensors double the per wheel cost. My 1997 Honda Civic got better gas mileage. I just wish I hadn't totaled it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle handles well and is a joy to drive. However, the road noise is greater than what I expected and the radio reception is unacceptable with constant static on local FM stations. The radio is fine as long as the car is not in motion. It immediately begins to crackle when in motion. The car has plenty of power for it's size and the gas mileage is wonderful. The head rests are set at a severe angle for short people and can't be adjusted unless a person removes them and reinstalls them backwards, with the angle toward the back seat.</TEXT>

Gas mileage has been getting better as it breaks in and currently gets 35+ on a trip and 31 around town, all spirited driving. The car handles great and has proved itself worthy in slush and snow with the factory tires. The drive is Sporty and very enjoyable, decent comfort and stereo make the miles slide by. The interior is very versatile and convenient to access with no stretching and fishing to get things in and out. Build quality seems good. The low beams have been my only real complaint and I had to adjust the headlamps up a bit in thw hilly area where I live. They are pleny bright however.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well overall I am VERY happy with this car. Last 5 vehicles were 2 Dodge Shelbys, 2 SUVs, and lastly my Acura RSX and I can say that the FIT offers something that I loved in each of those vehicles. I commute about 30 minutes one way in mixed driving in upstate NY. Only getting about 27 MPG which I'm a bit disappointed with since my RSX gave me 31 MPG right up until the day I traded it in at 108,000 miles. However, it has been very cold and snowy here and I have been using the heat/fan more than I normally would, so I am hoping my ave. MPG over a year will jump up quite a bit. I am hoping I just don't have the 1 Sport AT FIT that likes to eat gas as much as it does people and cargo.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a tall guy (6'6") who was looking for lots of leg and head room along with good fuel economy, and without spending lots of money. The Fit really fits! The legroom is fine, and the headroom is amazing (over 2"). I've filled the tank twice now, and got over 37 MPG each time--excellent for a car that's not even broken in yet. Acceleration isn't bad for such a small engine, and I can climb most grades at 55 MPH without downshifting out of 5th. All the useful options (cruise, power, side airbags) come standard on the Sport Fit. I like to drive my cars into the ground (10+yrs typ) so I don't miss the expensive-to-fix Lexus-type stuff at all. My impression is the Fit will go the distance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love how smooth the manual shifter is. Parking is a pleasure. It's no sports car, but the handling is so nimble and responsive I sometimes imagine I'm driving one.

I was sold on this car before I even drove it, but then was even more impressed with it. It is fun and peppy to drive despite not having a giant engine - can't beat the fuel economy short of spending double for a Prius, and it is solid design. Inside fuel cover area fills takes water during car wash, cheaped out on some little things (awful stock Dunlop tires), TPMS is a terrible requirement - makes winter wheels expensive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We needed a utility vehicle, and the Fit is really great. The seats that fold up are great for transporting our dog while the seats that fold down really help in carrying larger loads. The fuel economy is great. I drive only short distances to work and school, but it also does really well on the highway. I haven't taken it above 65, however. Not sure what it would do at faster speeds. The style is also great. I got a black one, and people really say it is a sharp car. I recommend the Fit highly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car for about a month and simply love it. I test drove every other car in the class and the fit was by far the best car. I live in the mountains and commute over 100 miles a day to and from work on winding roads, and this is by far the most fun I have had driving to work. This car's handling rivals many sports cars. I was initially a little worried about the small engine but it seems to be fairly pepppy. The cars interior especially the magic seats are truely first rate. I put the back seats in tall mode and put a blancket down on the floor and it is a perfect place for my dog to ride. I have been averaging about 34 miles to the gallon with fairly aggresive driving. Love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Fit a little over a month ago and I'm on my 5th tank of gas. I've haven't had as much fun driving a car since my first VW a long time ago. My mileage is great -- between 36 and 38. This is not interstate driving, but short commutes, some city, lots of rolling hills. I'm concerned about the clearance since I live where there is a lot of snow and mud. And I wish the seat had a height adjustment -- I use a small pillow. My only other complaint is that the seat fabric and the carpet look and feel cheap. But if you're looking for space, fun, great fuel economy and a reasonable price, this is your car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I was shopping for my first new car, I think I drove every car in its class. I found little things wrong with every single one of them, except the Fit. I am used to driving the family van, but did not want to buy a van because of how big they are and how much fuel they consume. The Fit has all the good parts of a van with all the good parts of a car. Lots of cargo space for a car this size. Seeing it from the outside does not do it justice. If you look on the inside you will see how much room there is in this thing. I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the car a few weeks ago & love it. Test drove others but found the Fit the best. Both myself (63" tall) & my husband (75") can drive it comfortably. This is the only car where he has inches of head rooms. The seat fold-down ability give it the best trunk space I have ever seen for a small car. Also like the ability to fold down the front seat level with the rear passenger & completely stretch out on long trips. Don't know yet about the mileage & reliability but Honda sells an extended warrenty that seems worth it. It is hard to find one of these as they mostly go to Europe & Japan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second car. We purchased it last week. Here are initial thoughts. As a second car intended for local driving, or as a city car, it is a good choice. The car handles well in turns and grips the road. The driver visibility is excellent, and the stylish interior appears to be of good quality (time will tell). We live in Pennsylvania with some steep slopes; the automatic transmission shifts gears going up hills. On occasion, the engine winds. Since it is a brand new car, I'm tentative about putting too much stress on the engine. The gas mileage is very good but not exceptional. One might expect more from such a light weight car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior allows for maximum use of space. The car also has a lot of head room; it seats four average size adults comfortably. People and things will "fit." Visibility is great, and responsive steering make driving fun. The price is good, and you get the assurance of the Honda brand.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We went out looking for a used CR-V, something my son could drive. Well after being disappointed in the used car pricing, I walked past the Fit, and asked how much. Next thing I was driving it around the block, putting it through its paces. Now my wife is driving my Pilot, my son is driving her CR-V, and I am driving the Fit. I am a BIG guy, 350+, and this car is still roomy. Quick to react, and it has more than ample power to go down the highway (at the speed limit). It has none of the bells and whistles of the Pilot, but it is more fun to drive. If you are looking around for a commuter, this is the car for you. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great handling, quick when it needs to be, and it is as easy to park as my Goldwing. If you are a Honda owner most of the controls are in the same spot (you don?t need to get use to where the windshield wiper controls are). For a small car it is tight as a drum, and it even has A/C. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After losing my 2007 Fit in a bad multicar collision my dealer got ahold of an 08 Fit sport for me. So far, car is nearly identical to the 07. The only major new feature is the government mandated tire pressure monitor system. Corrected from the 07 is the giant bar of rubber wiper blades that were notoriously loud in all but the heaviest of rains. They've been replaced with more standard looking blades. Windshield fit seems to be improved as well (the 07s have problems with rattle/whistling windshields that are corrected with some silicon sealer) Overall a great fun car to drive, lots of room for stuff, and easy on the wallet both at the dealer and pump</TEXT>

Work out really great bringing husband home from hospital with knee replacement surgery. Folded front seat back and made the chaise-longue position. He was totally comfortable for the 3 hour drive home. Heating and AC systems work great. Love the sound system. Plenty of drink holders.

<TEXT>I have found the Fit to be quite adaptable to the nasty weather. Some reviews are a bit harsh as far winter ready. The Fit has a very decent heating system. If you leave the vents open, just as in any vehicle the defrost will clear the entire car easily. Here in Colorado I have been in many situations where the best heating system in the world cannot keep up with the conditions that the mountains can throw at it. From Audi to Subaru. I do not find an issue with the Fit's heat and defrost. If the vent blows in your face, good lord move it! My Fit averages 32 MPG and is a great vehicle. Between the Subaru and the Honda I own the top two vehicles in the world for quality.</TEXT>

My family and I have used it for weekend trips and we have plenty of room for everything. It has decent power but if you looking at this car of HP you are looking in the wrong place. It is a great everyday driver and I have never got under 30 mpg in the city. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the Fit for a year now and LOVE IT!! The gas mileage has been very good 30.1 in town and 47 highway. It is high quality - both in the interior and exterior. No rattles in interior and the fit and finish is very high quality.After looking at Yaris this was the best value for the bucks. I love the folding seats!! This is a fun car to drive, love the paddle shifters. Love the stereo - enjoy the jazz. After working many years for Toyota in service I was impressed by the quality of this car as it far surpassed Toyota. For the Fit nay sayers you really are missing out on the high quality of this car. I recommend this car to all my friends!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Up until real winter started two weeks ago, our 2008 Honda Fit Sport has been great. It is a little uncomfortable if it is icey or snowy, since then we can't use the cruise on slippery surfaces and the gas pedal angle is weird. Other than that, I thought it was the perfect commuter car, until I drove it last night at 3 degrees F. All the windows fogged over. If the defrost was on full bore, 2/3 of the windshield was clear. If not, only 1/2 windshield was clear. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my automatic Fit Sport for about 1 1/2 years and would not recommend it. Gas mileage is only about 28 in city. A/C bogs down engine power and can't cool consistently in heat of AZ summer - goes warm, cold, warm, cold. Inner upholstery is a lint magnet. Biggest peeve - Car is noisy and rattly over-all, with a major rattle inside the dash. Had this from the beginning, service can't seem to fix it. Visibility is poor with huge blind spots on front sides and very hard to see when backing up, especially if you are short like me. Tires go low on air, alignment goes out easily, engine making a high- pitched sound, service says they "can't hear it." Same for rubbing sound when turning left.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been driving my basic Honda Fit for a couple of months now, and while it is great fun to drive and thrills me when I fill it up with gas for under $25, I have gotten slightly frustrated with not having a "magic button" for the door locks. Additionally, the gray/black interior makes it very difficult to see inside at night, especially when the inside light goes off immediately when you turn off the ignition. In the high side, it has great cargo space with the back seats folded down, and the sound system is adequate. My last vehicle was a small pickup so I am really impressed with the fuel economy and the ease of handling. Wish I had bought the Sport model now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for the best car in the market. I couldn't afford a glitzy sports car, but didn't want a twerpy little car with no features. I saw the Fit and instantly found my choice. Something you might not realize - this thing is peppy around town; it's got some definite "scoot," especially anything under 40 mph. Moreover, when the conditions are right, and you're not driving with a speeding ticket in mind, you can easily achieve well over 40+ mpg- I have. I'm spoiled now to the point that ANYTHING below 34 mpg is BAD. One last thing - - the sound system in the car: awesome. The sport's 4 mids and 2 tweeters are what surprised me most. I planned to put in an aftermarket system - no need!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had it four, long months. We don't drive for fun, merely to get there. The lame mileage of 27 in town and MAYBE 36 on the highway (minimum of 1,000 miles needed) make this a lousy deal. Unless you drive with an egg under your foot, the car jack-rabbits to 35 miles-per-hour and then slogs along. If you floor it, it does the same thing, only more loudly. Power to pass on the freeway (where else do you need it?) is meager, and non-existent with the air-conditioning on. The electric window switches aren't lighted and are hard to locate in the dark. All doors can only be locked and unlocked from the driver's door. Otherwise you have to key them individually. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Fit for 3 months now, it's my first new car and I love it. It fits so easily into tight parking spots, can turn in incredibly small areas and has plenty of room on the inside! However, I am only getting about 20-22 mpg.. WAY less than was advertised and the front lower spoiler that comes standard on the sport is too low. It scrapes whenever I have to go in or out of a driveway unless I am creeping very slowly, which doesn't work if I am entering or crossing traffic. But all in all I love my Fit, it is much superior to my '98 Saturn that I was driving. I would suggest this car to anyone who enjoys driving and often find themselves with a car full of people</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the Fit due to the great gas mileage and the design of the folding back sit. It works great! It is a very versatile car. The back holds a lot more than it appears to be able to hold. The gas mileage is between 27 with mostly city driving to 41 with all highway driving. It has a good average of 30 to 32 MPG combo. The only thing I wish it would redesign is that the gas tank hold more than 10.8 gal. It seems to go through gas faster that way. A 12 to 13 would be great. I average about 280 to 400 miles per fill up. This car is a great buy. Plus another added feature is it shows percent of oil life so it takes the guess work out of when to change the oil. AC works great too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Honda Fit has been a great car so far. Not only do I average 32-33 miles per gallon (less on E10, unfortunately), the tight steering and quick shifter makes every drive enjoyable. With only 109 horsepower it's not a stoplight racer, but the 1.5 L mill is more than adequate for driving in the city and pulling the Fit's ~2600 lbs up to highway speeds. While it's no plush luxury car, the Fit's interior space belies its diminutive size, as four people can fit in the Fit in relative comfort. Then with a few clicks of the "magic seats" you can fill the car with furniture, boxes, etc.</TEXT>

Rear visibility is blocked by the rear seat head rests. Tire noise is excessive.

Lots of usable cargo space, simple user-friendly interior, dash and controls, and is a blast to drive. Didn't think an economical car could be fun to drive, but the Fit is. Granted, it's no Mini or Mazda3 or real sports car, but it's by far the most sporty of the economy hatchbacks and while it may not have the power that a real sports car has, it sure feels like one. Has to count for something, IMHO. Requires extra responsibility when driving.</TEXT>

I have not put it on the highway yet to test, but most of my driving is in the city, granted I live in Baton Rouge and we have terrible traffic, but i live 2 miles from work and don't go outside that realm during the week.

<TEXT>This Sport Fit is just great. I have as much front driving room as I had in a Mercury Sable. Just excellent for a 2 person car. I love it cause the room in the back when the seats are folded down is awesome. This little gas saver is loaded from a base sticker. I mean everything. Stereo is the best sound I have ever heard in a car. If you want to drive in a manual mode in an automatic transmission you can control that with a touch of a steering wheel button. You can gear down fast to a stop. I have had it up against so similar cars I will not mention and this one has class to it.

<TEXT>On my first tank in my 5 speed I got 34.5 mpg and that included some mountain driving - with plenty of power. My second and third tanks have been slightly over 40mpg mixed driving. I don't know where they get the EPA estimate of 28-34. I'm also very happy with how fun it is to drive (sport-car feel), the great gas mileage, and the interior space that feels like it rivals my wife's Escape. Besides much better gas mileage than advertised, my 5 speed with the 1.5 liter engine has more spunk than my big old 6 cylinder Explorer does (or ever did). When some say the Fit doesn't have enough power I'm amazed unless maybe they have the automatic which isn't quite as good on power or mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my sixth 'new' Honda purchase, all others were Civics, both manual and AT,and I've never experienced such low mileage,in spite of driving in the same manner for 35 years. I average 20 (TWENTY!) mpg, with city/ highway combined. On one 'semi' long trip the mileage climbed to 24. Now, I am still below the supposed 1,000 mile 'break in' point, but do plan to have the vehicle examined, as I purchased it for its size, ease and mileage! GUARANTEED? Should the mileage PROBLEM be solved, I'd recommend this vehicle highly. There are options one can purchase to solve any concerns listed below. Most owners report great mileage. The MT FIT gets up to 40,as DOES my 1991/MT Honda Civ-140K!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the BLUE color. Easy to zoom into a prkg space from the opposite direction. Head room is exceptional! I am 5'9" (kinda tall for a female), and much of it is 'torso'. I've 5 more " of head space~ more than ANY of my previous 5 NEW Civ's! LOVE the cargo sp. Don't lv bk seats down unless abs nec! ;D</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since 1991 I have only driven Honda cars. I have never had any major repairs. This Fit measures up and surpasses my expectations. It is an incredible small car. I get 32 mpg in or out of traffic, virtually no road noise and the performance is equal to anything else I have driven. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I now have 5,000 miles on this car. I've tried to give it the benefit of doubt, but I am so frustrated with it. The engine has an annoying knock/tick on acceleration, so much, that bystanders on the street acknowledge it. Of course, the Honda mechanics don't hear it. This Fit is a squirrelly beast in the snow, and is a frightening plow, rather than "fun to drive". Having lived in Alaska for many years, I do know how to drive in snow! Luckily I no longer live there. The paint quality is less than "quality". I have the Blackberry Pearl, sport model. I highly suggest choosing a Civic over a Fit, if handling, noise, and fuel economy are important to you. I miss my Civic, LOTS! </TEXT>

I love everything about this car, i loved the economy and performance so much i traded in my 2007 ridgeline for the fit.

<TEXT>After reading many conflicting reviews about space for taller drivers I decided to test drive one to see if I'd 'fit' (sorry). To my surprise I had plenty of room, just as much leg room and lots more head room than my '97 Grand Prix. I'm 6'6" and 280+ w/ size 14 feet. I had no problems whatsoever with the pedals being too close to me or each other (in both the manual and the auto). The steering wheel does not feel too far away to me, in my normal driving position, my arms are still slightly bent, but if I want to feel "racy" I can press my back into the seat and feel like I'm driving a race car with my arms stretched out. It's got plenty of pep for a car of its class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the AUX input for iPods or any other audio device. The myriad options for folding the seats is great and the huge cargo area. Awesome Blackberry Pearl color - very unique (at least at the moment, I've been seeing more of then as of late).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got 42 mpg freeway from Phoenix, az to irvine, ca. City so far is about 27-28 mpg carrying 3 people most of that time. Fun to drive, lots of pep. Costco runs not a problem. So much room that the back seats don't need to be folded down. Picked up relative from the airport with luggage and could have still fit a 4th person in the car. Reasonably comfortable for the price point. This is a great choice to replace a large SUV because you can still "fit" lots of stuff and don't fee like you're giving anything up. Haven't used my Jeep commander in weeks because this is so much fun to drive and has much better mpg than my Jeep's 12 mpg city. Not the cutest, but definitely the most practical!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I transitioned from a basic, bare-bones Toyota Echo to the 2008 Honda Fit--what a difference. MPG is less than I was used to, but this is much more of a car and well worth the slight decrease in mileage. This car is fun and solid to drive; pickup is great, especially for a car with such little horsepower, and the car is very comfortable on long road trips. The sport model is worth the higher price, since those little luxuries all factor into the enjoyment of driving this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So I had a Prius on hold across town, to replace my pricey Lexus, which had been costing me $200 a month in gas. But $28K is a lot of money. So on impulse, I drove into the Honda lot and saw Fit looking at me. He was hot! Drove like a dream, the folding options make him one big origami machine (for my gardening/furniture/ kid stuff). I'm getting over 30 MPG for $10K less than a Prius.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, I really like this car. Runs smooth, very easy to get use to it. Even though, this is a small compact car, I still have the feeling of driving a very well built, very good quality vehicle. Before I purchased it I had visited other competitors in the same class and this car had definitely won the interior design contest for me. Gas mileage in the city is around 29/30, it's not bad, but not very impressive either. I recommend this car to anyone who wants to save money on the long run, prefers good quality, not looking for something fancy and doesn't have a big family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We're thrilled with our Fit sport. It has delivered great gas mileage, 30MPG around town, 33-38 MPG highway. It's interior is well thought out and comfortable. For an entry level car, the interior materials and quality are superb. The exterior design is excellent. The Sport trim gives the car a better look versus the standard model. While it's not a rocket, the engine has some pep and good torque. The hills in our area are no problem for motor. When the A/C is on, the small displacement of the engine robs some of the power. The handling is great for this little car. It's a firm ride, the lower profile tires don't help, but the trade off is you get crisp handling and grip. I like the steering too</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Fit last September. Had to order because they were in short supply. It is a manual transmission, the only way to go in my opinion as it is very peppy and fun to drive. Have been getting up to 44 mpg in ideal conditions, but usually in the mid to upper 30's with a mix. Strictly town it has been under 30mpg at times. So, mpg varies widely depending on how you drive and what kind of traffic. The manual transmission is so fun to drive that mpg can suffer from that. (The best mpg is conservative driving.) It has an amazing amount of cargo space and that is what really sold us on this car. We keep the back seats folded down almost all of the time. We love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Honda fit brings something new to the world of compacts; standards. Everything that was called an option before is now standard. Loads of airbags, ABS power windows, the works. Its all standard. Sure somethings could have been better, but for the most part, having standards doesn't make me ask the dealer to fetch a model that has all the features I want. Only drawback is that I don't see myself using this car for a cross country road trip although the loads of space and adjustable seats does suggest that it would be a good idea. Great for a daily commuter. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car now for about 3 months and have put close to 3000 miles on it. So far, so good. It is really fun to drive. It drives like a sports car, and handles extremely well. It feels super responsive. Minor complaints: It has developed a slight rattle/squeak in the dash when on a slightly bumpy street. Also, the A/C will sometimes smell bad when first turned on (this goes away after 10 seconds or so) I need to take it to the dealer as I hear this is a common problem with newer car AC systems. Otherwise, I can't think of anything bad about it. I've been recommending it to friends that are looking for a new car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I get to write another review because we got a second Fit. After such a good experience with our first Fit purchased at the end of March, we found we could hardly bear to drive our Dodge Grand Caravan; too ponderous and the gas mileage was atrocious. The Dodge was a '99 with 120K miles and was beginning to need work. We got an internet deal lined up for a Milano Red base 5-sp manual for MSRP and waited a month to get it. So we are now a two Fit family. My Democrat wife gets the Tidewater Blue Fit and with my Republican leanings I get the Milano Red Fit, so we are properly color coded. Humor aside, these are truly great little cars with a wonderful combination of economy and utility.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Again, fuel efficiency (we are averaging 38 mpg for Fit #1 with a best tank at 44.9 mpg), almost as much fun to drive as my motorcycles on the twisties, tremendous utility and versatility, styling (we wanted another '08 over an '09), and Honda build quality and reliability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the Fit to replace a Mazda5 (destroyed in a crash) And I was worried about "downgrading" I shouldn't have as the Fit is a fabulous little car to drive. I put LOTS of miles on my cars every year so interior design and comfort are very important to me. The Fits seats are actually some of the best I have sat in ever, much to my surprise coming from the Mazda which had chair height seats. This car is NOT underpowered for every day driving, I live in the mountains of WV and so far the Fit has zero problems climbing hills in fifth gear. Best of all is an average fuel economy of 40 honest to god MPG for my 70 mile one way commute, it doesn't get any better than that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After reading up on the fit for a year or so, I decided to buy one in Apr 08. The gas mileage is great, averaging 35 mostly city. I average 33- 35 and when driving mostly freeway I avg 35-38 so a little better than expected and the main reason I purchased the fit.It is very smooth compared to my Nissan Truck-it will depend on what you are used to. I take long trips to DC and Philly-about 500 miles and my right leg cramps up so long trips can be tough if you don't take a lot of breaks (I usually only stop twice and for very short periods of time.) The 2009 has a arm rest and other improved features, recommend waiting, supposedly will get over 40 but love the 2008, no regrets.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The gas mileage. I do use Shell gas which is recommended by Honda (Top Tier Gas-Google it). The price is great. Great value considering the safety features and gas mileage.

<TEXT>The Fit is a good little car. The storage area and flexibility are unmatched. I bought a new mower and was concerned about it fitting in such a small car. I got the mower in easily and figured I could have carried 2 more (3 total). Amazing. The car steers easily and the gas mileage is decent but could be better. Plenty of pep, both in town and on the highway. No problems. So far mileage has been between 32 and 40, with 35-36 average. Most of my driving is in town or suburban areas. The 40 MPG was on a trip to Dallas. I don't like the silver color, electric windows, electric locks--but there was no choice. The exterior design is cheap (a couple of stripes would help).

<TEXT>Hi all! We never even drove the fit before buying it! It reminded us of our first new 1977 Honda CVCC and that car was one of the best we ever owned. I picked the car up in the Pittsburgh area and drove it back to Lancaster, PA (252 miles). All of the driving was at speeds of 55-70 mph. MPG was 39 and this car had no miles when purchased. I can't believe how quiet this car is. I really was expecting much more road noise. The Fit took all the hills of Western PA without a hitch. Not once did I have to floor it to make it up any hills or to maintain the speed limit. The interior is just flat out perfect. The materials reminded us of our Accord Ex. The handling was perfect. My wife is in love </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I've never drove a car that handled this well! The radio is so much better than any other Honda I've been in. Tons of room. I'm 6'5" and it FIT me perfect.

<TEXT>I bought my Honda Fit after my 1997 Chevy Blazer's transmission went. I wanted to get something that had a much better fuel economy and better track record as far as maintenance (Honda). I also still wanted to have a vehicle that would allow for cargo in the back. The Honda Fit met all of the criteria. It is so easy to drive, and the fuel economy is great (remember I drive a Blazer, so this is a shock). The only thing that bothers me is the acceleration is delayed and it seems like it races before it kicks into gear. Maybe it's because it a 4cyl and I'm used to a 6cyl. I also have noticed it's worse when you have the AC on. Other than that, I love my Fit. I hope to have it for many years.</TEXT>

The Fit just took our family of 4 (children 6 and 9) and all our gear on a 2 week 4300 mile trip west. It handled the mountains and 75 mph on the interstate just fine and 32 to 41 mpg to boot. The lower economy occurred at 75 mph into a strong head wind. This car drives bigger than it is, handles well, and the paddle shifters are fun when pushing the car on curvy roads. I'm 6'2" and I was comfortable for all 4300 miles. Sure enjoyed the mp3's across the many miles of fields and cows...</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has an incredible fun factor when driving it. It's zippy without feeling "weak" and steering is very nice. I bought the "Storm Silver Metallic" which I think complements the body design the best (goes great with the alloy wheels on the Sport trim). The interior is ridiculously roomy for what you think it would have for space. I'm 6'2" and my there is something like 6" clearance above me still. The instrumentation is very sharp. The lighting/color/font scheme is very attractive and something I wouldn't expect in a sub-$20K car. Paddle shifters add another dimension to the enjoyability of the ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a Geo Prizm before and wanted something that gave me at least the same MPG (30-31). This car gives me 38+ if I drive on the freeway, with the AC on. Amazing! The magic seats are fun and definitely useful. I realized that it is usually me by myself or with a passenger and it's useful to have all that room for cargo. People say the backseat is roomier than my old car as well. The lowest MPG I got was 34, and that came after driving really fast on the freeway. I got this car for under 15K and it was worth every penny. More expensive than the Yaris, but worth it with the safety features, etc. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel Efficiency, the dials look cool, magic seats! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love this car, fun, quick, great ride for a car this size. I test drove several different models before selecting the Honda Fit. I studied reviews of all models for fuel economy, price, resale, and environmental impact. The Fit was my choice and is a purely fun to drive.Handles great!!! Honda has done it again. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Small size - big storage. Easy to park and maneuver in urban traffic. The sound quality on the CD/Radio really surprised me. Oh - - - did I mention 32 to 38 m.p.g.! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>HONDA FIT is inexpensive to buy and own, good on gas, and had a big hole in the back. The Fit "fit" all of those. Light, quick and nimble, perfect for country roads and city streets. Also holds its own on the highway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite Features Drivability, economy, build quality, novel use of interior space. Car feels much bigger than expected when sitting inside. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did months of research and test drove the Fit Sport and waited some more before I decided to buy the Fit. I cannot get accustomed to the seats and the clutch. My back and left leg have hurt since buying the car. I have waited hoping my muscles will adjust but no deal-I will be taking the car back to see if the dealership can help a girl out-any suggestions?</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is terrific. We just took our first road trip and packed the vehicle to the gills. Two road bikes in the "magic seat area", two large suit cases, a small one, a box of food, laptops, hanging clothes, and more in the rear. The car was very comfortable up front for my wife and I and got just under 40 mpg during the highway drive. Obviously some of this wouldn't be possible if we had kids, but this is all the car a couple could need in every respect.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The unbelievable amount of room inside a very small shell. The fuel economy is better than I anticipated. The ride is very adequate and the vehicle has no difficulty keeping up with everyone else on the highway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love my new 2008 Sport Automatic. I researched small high mpg cars for about a year before I decided on the Fit. The FIT is a GREAT car to drive. Fun, sporty & economical!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pluses: great cargo space, head room, rear leg room, interior & exterior design, maneuverability & quick reaction. We put 2 teenagers and a toddler in the backseat just as comfortably as our passat- with more leg room and our 40 lb dog has plenty of room in the back, which was a surprise for us! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought my Vivid Blue Fit Sport 5 speed last night. I was comparing a Scion xD with the Fit Sport. I was ready to buy the Scion because dealer mark-up is usually higher on Hondas, whereas a Scion has a "pure-price" pricing policy. I got my Fit for MSRP, which is pretty good. The Fit felt more solid and has more configuration options for interior space. I like the short throw shifter action and handling. I've always preferred Hondas over Toyotas and I'm not disappointed. Great car, good m.p.g. overall. Upgraded from a 1983 Mercedes turbodiesel wagon. More m.p.g. but less interior space and thinner sheet metal, but overall very pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blue-lit gauges, short-throw shifter action, great handling, funky looks (especially in bright Vivid Blue), standard features, seating/loading configurations, m.p.g.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When the first Fits started hitting the road I was happy to see Honda start selling this smaller, Japanese-city styling car in America. I am a single male with a dog and I don't need these huge gas guzzling cars that everyone is driving! The fits looks great, inside there is much more room than it looks, from the drivers seat you would think you were driving an Acura. Top quality materials everywhere, instrument cluster with big, bright easy to see instrumentation, great stereo with cool blue illuminated face, plays my mp3 player, lots of storage space, lots of Glass for a big view out, great leather wrapped steering wheel. And the automatic has paddle shifters on the steering wheel!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything! i like how the instrumentation (tachometer, speedometer, gas gauge) is bright and lit up even during the day with cool blue, red and white expressions. the paddle shifters work great..the rear seats you can flip up the bottoms leaving you 4 vertical feet of space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was shopping for an economical car that would be small enough to park but large enough to hold saddles, horse equipment, an occasional hay bale, and the mastiff. The Fit is it! My elderly mastiff can get in either through the hatchback or the door, I can loan and unload the cargo area, and it's zippy to drive. Looks a little strange, but the inside use of space is astonishing. I'm old enough that the safety features appeal to me, and I like the visibility. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the stereo system and the height of the cargo area.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We searched various brands and many styles of small cars. We were looking for something roomy inside yet small and very fuel efficient. The Honda Sports Fit fills and exceeds all our expectations. We have used three tanks of gas so far, 1st tank 28.9 mpg, 2nd tank 30.01 mpg, and 3rd tank 30.08 mpg in town, stop and go driving. The Fit is fun to drive. It corners great. The acceleration is faster than I expected from a small car. A perfect fit for my 6'2" size. We have received many compliments on the Fit from friends and strangers. I feel it is impossible to give too much praise for the Sport Fit. It is truly a perfect Fit for our needs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Averaging over 30 mpg. Cornering is great. Roomy interior with plenty of head room. Lots of storage space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love this car, fun, quick, great ride for a car this size. I looked at a number of small cars the fit was a hands down winner, you can't beat the amount of room in this car. The first two tanks of gas 35 mpg the next two 39 mpg can't wait to hit 40+, anyone who is'nt geting 30+ needs to slow down.</TEXT>
