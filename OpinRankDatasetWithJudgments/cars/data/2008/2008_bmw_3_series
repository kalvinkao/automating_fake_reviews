<TEXT>I ordered my car a few years ago and for the most part have really liked it with a few caveats. Its been driven to Montana in the snow and handled Seattle snow-pocolypse '09 with flying colors. I think it handles better in the snow than my previous subarus. The caveats: The fuel pump has been replaced twice due to factory flaw (warranty repair) and this series of car has consistent issues with the brakes making noise as you take off (not under braking). BMW currently will not fix it. The service experience has me re-thinking the car. I may go to something smaller and slightly more fuel efficient for commuting. It wouldn't be an issue if I bought a truck, but this is a BMW. I expected more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As you can see above, I like the car. That said, I feel the dealers take advantage of the customer. This is a lease, and I need their approved service. They charged by $309 for a wheel alignment which could have been sold with poor alignment. Who's to know. Also, I was charged $483.00 for a tire replacement (simple nail). This is outrageous. According to the dealer, run-flats cannot be repaired. Again, I was stuck with the dealer recommendation. Run-flats are a poor excuse for "saving" the weight of a spare and "peace of mind" to be able to go 50 miles at 50mph (try that on an L.A. freeway). One must use secondary roads if one does not want to get rear- ended.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nicely appointed car with the driving excitement of a mid 90's Ford Taurus. 6 speed shiftable automatic transmission is rough in automatic modes and sluggish when shifted with paddles. Handling gives little road feel, and the car does very poorly on wet roads. Excessive road noise at highway speeds with original run-flat tires. BMW has managed to engineer the fun out of this very quick sedan. Gas mileage on premium is poor. Driver comfort with sport seats is very good, but the front passenger seat is cramped for an average adult. Many of the car's electronic features work only on an intermittent basis. The car is a real disappointment at $50K+ fully equipped.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hands down the best car I've ever driven. Bought this car new almost 2 years ago. Still loving it and I'm averaging 24.2 MPG! (and I drive it hard). Had a few minor electrical issues that have been fixed for free, but I'm a bit nervous about the cost after the warranty expires. Definitely a small car though and not ideal for families if this is your primary ride. Run flats are stupid, but I've had no problems with mine. AWD in the winter is insane! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>POWER, so fast. When you're driving 90, it feels like you're driving 45. AWD is phenomenal in the winter. I can plow through six inches of snow and get up the hill in my driveway no problem. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first BMW and I don't know that I'll ever go back. The car is firm, responsive, and powerful despite it being the low-man on the totem pole compared to the 335i and M3. Plenty of room (I'm 6'4") and an achievable purchase at slightly less than $30k.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>disappointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Bought a 328xi sport coupe after previously owning 2 Audi TTs. The worst feature is the run flat tires. Ride is very harsh and the $300+ to replace is outrageous. Ruined one in the first 300 miles on an Interstate pothole. Had to drive 150 miles @ 50 MPH. At least it lasted more than the advertised 50 mi. The odometer and speedometer are 6-7% high (that's worth about $400 on a 30,000 mile lease). Poor design 12V port in center storage area is in a position that won't allow the lid to close when any of my eqpt plugs are inserted. Gas mileage is poor. Lucky to get 18 MPG even on Interstate. TT with DSG got >25 MPG, weighed about the same and was quicker. 328 automatic is crude compared to Audi.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 335xi after my 1999 Volvo S80 T6 died after 300,000 miles. The engine, transmission, and drivetrain are more connected than any competitive model tested. The steering is precise and it a blast to drive. I still smile when I hear it's subtle exhaust note when I start it in the morning. The AWD system is very good in all conditions but the run flat tires are not designed for snow. They were OK in winter #1 but will invest in snows next fall. My biggest challenge has been reliability. They had to replace the front wheel bearings at 14K miles and I broke down at 17K miles and had to be towed to the dealership to replace the fuel pump and repair an oil pan leak. Not what I expected.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The twin turbo. Bluetooth is better than wife's Audi by a mile. I get comments about the clarity. Adaptive headlights are great and LED's on door handles is a nice touch. iDrive is great after the first couple days. It's easier than Audi's MMI in my opinion. Maintenance plan.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has been everything I expected and more. There is no other car in this price range that has the combination of handling, performance and overall design appeal. I ordered a 6 speed with white exterior/red interior and aluminum trim; it is stunning in my opinion and draws attention everywhere I go. While the 328 does not have the overall power of the 335, it provides just as much enjoyment as an everyday car. The X- drive handles snow and rain providing a secure feeling on par with Audi's I have owned previously. I look forward to driving every time I get into the car... it is more than transportation, it is a joy to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third BMW and the best one by far. The 335i moves off the line so quick you'd swear you were in a M3 or better? My last car was a 2005 330ci with the M sport package on it and I didn't think anything would rival the driving prowess of that car. Well, I was wrong! I strongly agree with one of the other reviews written earlier - this car is underrated! If you want speed coupled with amazing handling then don't look any further.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our family's first BMW, and what a terrific car it is. Ours is Blk/Blk, with the manual and sport package. After driving it I can say that this convertible is one of the best handling cars I have ever driven. Taking a winding road immediately puts a smile on your face as you take the corners and row through the gears. The top operation is amazing and when it is up not only does it not look like a convertible, but it also has a very quiet interior that is free of rattles and wind noise associated with convertible tops. The interior is very decadent with very rich leather over all surfaces. This is a true 4 season car that is absolutely gorgeous top up or down. Great purchase!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wonderous turbo engine!! Always has power and torque on demand even in 6th gear. Great tranny! Handles like a dream. Rich interior. Room for 4. Hardtop makes owning a convertible in Oregon possible. Sport seats that hug you tight. Great heater and htd. seats for top down weather in the 50s.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up vehicle on Saturday, 3/22 - Comf & Sport. Took the long way home. Acceleration with Steptronic AT was fast & smooth. Love the sound of the throaty engine just before the upshift. You know that you're in a sportscar. The paddle shifters are cool, but I don't suspect I'll use them much on my commute. 328i corned like it was on rails. I took a couple of twisty bends on a backroad at about 60 mph with no sense of skid, roll or fishtail. I had to be careful not to push too hard as the wheels lifted off the ground coming over one little roller. With top down and windows up (38F outside), there was little buffeting of either occupant's hair. Kept warm with heat on auto at 84F.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Top down, hardtop, great cruise control, wonderful seats, nice sounding engine, Love that it's AT, but I can pretend to have manual with the paddle shifters. When 4 yo saw the top go down he called it a "transformer car". Two toddler seats fit in the back seats with the car headrests taken out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third BMW and all of the new features are very disappointing. The navigation system is a joke, the sales person told me that the reason it is not a touch screen is because it encourages drivers to pay to attention to the road. Try getting anywhere with a big button that controls everything and one mistake will force you to start over. I love BMWs for driving and I love the way they look but if you have recently moved and are looking for assitance in navigating through a city like Los Angeles this is not the car for you. In addition, the new cup holders block the passengers air vents and they are not convenient at all. The new placement of the window controls is not user friendly.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The automatic has great "pick-up" and the car hugs the road. It is a great car for major metropolitan areas as accelerating is never a problem and one can fit into most parking spaces but the inside is pleasantly roomy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove the new 335i coupe in an effort to give BMW a chance. I've always owned Infinitis, and was planning on buying the new G37, which looks just awesome. In my eyes the G37 seemed like a better deal on paper, but after driving the BMW, you definitely realise why there is such a price disparity. I can now understand why BMW owners are so loyal; I've never driven a car that feels like this! The solidity, grip, material quality, attention to detail all far outshine anything I've owned before. I love every aspect of this car, down to the seat belt stalks that bring your seat belt to you when you close the door & the beautiful ambient light surrounding the cabin at night. Brilliant.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Material quality is tops, unbelievable handling and driver feel, beautiful subtle exterior style, free maintenance, German attention to detail (e.g., able to run the vent/heater while car is parked), safety, European delivery, iDrive (not nearly as difficult as rumoured), BMW concierge.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Dark green, beige leather, premium, sport, comfort access, cold weather, iPod, iDrive. This is a 3,700 mile/6 month ownership update from an early post. My third BMW. (Still have the '73 2002tii I bought new.) Moved to 335 from an '02 330 Ci, which I loved. I look for excuses to drive this car. Handling is superb, engine smooth and alarmingly powerful. I like the iDrive. I really don't like the run flat idea (though they handle well). Driver's cup holder is goofy. Upgraded audio, iPod and Bluetooth excellent. Nav screen doesn't switch to black background at night - dumb. Gas mileage OK for this much power, but.. Too early for reliability, replaced brake bulb.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Suspension and handling; engine smoothness and torque; styling; seats;, adaptive headlights; sound system and iPod integration; Bluetooth; surprising rear seat room and comfort, though access is difficult for a six-footer, and likely impossible for someone older. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>An otherwise fine car is marred by the standard vinyl "leatherette" seats that have no place on a luxury sports car. While "leatherette" may look fine, no matter what you call it, vinyl is hot, sticky and uncomfortable. Why don't they just offer and market honest cloth seats on the base model. BMW was remarkably uncooperative in addressing the complaint. While the seats could have easily been recovered in leather, BMW wanted a whopping $6,000 for the leather covers (when the leather package costs only $1,350 to order). The car is nimble and great fun to drive, but the standard seats and total lack of customer support are troubling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sport package is fantastic. Tight, nimble handling, but not at all a harsh ride. 6 speed manual is also crisp and fun to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My car has everything except the sports package and HD radio. Everything works very well, even the iDrive that people seem to hate. It could be a bit more intuitive, but it is not useless. Real time traffic information isn't very helpful. Navigation works pretty good, but at some intersections, information didn't come soon enough. RFTs make the steering heavier. When I got a nail in one of them, it took several days to get a replacement. Power top mechanism works very well. With the top up, you get a decent cargo space, I think. With the top down, you still have a space enough for a couple of airplane carry on size bags. No mechanical problem so far at 2000 miles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good acceleration, power top mechanism. Good handling, good visibilty with the top up. Maintenance program like no other. Fit and finish. Great colors. Quietness. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased a 335i sedan and took delivery 10 days ago. Without a doubt, this is the best car I have ever owned. I was a diehard Audi driver for many years (A4, S4, A6). The handling and acceleration are phenomenal. This car is nimble, agile, and very quiet even at cruising speeds of 80mph. I am getting 21mpg in city driving and the car has not even been broken in yet. The torque curve is great and allows for acceleration in any gear without any engine stress. I can't wait to open it up a little after the break-in period. I even like the run flat tires (sort of). I was pleasantly surprised at the ride they give coupled with the sport package and manual transmission. Get this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased in Jan. and had it built in Germany. That is cool, custom built. The more I drive it, more I like it. I have automatic, and seems it is little sluggish off the line, but not a big deal. the 328xi may not be as powerful as 335 as I have read, but it is plenty. The coupe has plenty of trunk room for coupe. Single guys, you will love it. I am in Mass. and the 328xi is great in snow, and ice. No regrets. Great style, handling. Worth the wait. Keep eye on speed, easy to fly with ease, and quietness. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Edmunds alludes, in its full test, to the potential for aftermarket chips to greatly improve the performance of this car. I can attest to this, having installed Dinan performance software about a week after delivery of the car. My car pulls extremely strong, especially north of 3000 rpm. Plus, Dinan matches BMW's 4/50 powertrain warranty. I love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is truly amazing! I only have 300 miles on it, but it is a dream. Accelerates effortlessly, rides smoothly with sport package compared to Infiniti. The iDrive is absolutely amazing. It is very intuitive. HD radio clarity is superior, way better than the sirius satellite radio that is installed. The bluetooth system displays all of my contact information from my iPhone, including missed calls. Seats are very comfortable. As long as the car remains reliable, I see no reason to ever buy another brand. Premium, Sport, Comfort Access, Navi, Automatic. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The iDrive. The steptronic transmission in that you do not have to manually shift in the sport mode, it just revs higher. Comfort access, Bluetooth is amazing. Can use my iPhone via bluetooth with the built in iPod at the same time. Trunk space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was debating between the BMW 3- Series and Infiniti G35 Journey. The G35 would cost the same price with navigation and 300+ HP. I went for the BMW because of the luxurious cabin and sporty exterior. Reliability has been spot-on since day one. Build quality is best I have seen in years. Even with the sport package, the Grey Leather Seats seem to be supportive and comfortable. The Monaco Blue is a great color and it goes well with the Grey Leather. Sport package is definitely worth the extra money. I did not buy the navigation because of iDrive. Xenon is great. This car grips to the road amazing too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took ownership of my 335i coupe in Oct. 2007. Space Grey exterior w/Cream Beige interior. After waiting 3 months for it to arrive from Germany, I was wondering if it was really worth all the hype... ABSOLUTELY!! By far the most amazing drive ever! If you can pony up the extra cash for the twin-turbos, you won't be disappointed. Effortless acceleration. Truly fun to drive! I find myself making excuses to drive any and everywhere! Beautiful interior. Nav and iPod integration are a must. The only knock to the inside is the cupholders?!? But if cupholders make or break car buying, get a minivan! Previously owned a Lexus and have no regrets switching to BMW! Truly the ultimate driving machine!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 335 coupe is the fastest car I've ever owned. I constantly find that I'm driving a lot faster than I should. It's quiet, handles like a slot car and accelerates like a V-8. Mileage is almost the same as my 10 year old 3 series. The ride with the sport suspension is harsh over rough pavement. Road noise is noticable over anything other than very smooth road. IDrive requires a learning curve. It's not intuitive, but once you get the hang of it, you have a lot of information and a lot more control over the functions of your car. Although it handles well, it is a very heavy car for its size. Brakes are a little touchy, but stop the car on a dime. The windshield is raked back steeply.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the car less than a year -- already had to get the passenger front seat replaced. (The stitching came undone and the stuffing was coming out!) Already had to get the windshield replaced. (There was a stress fracture caused by the rain sensor? That's what they told me.) Had to replace most of the rear brake light bulbs (car only a few months old, remember. Never had to keep replacing the bulbs with my other cars). Tire pressure monitor light comes on even when the pressure is correct. Run flat tires stink!

<TEXT>I love this wagon. Have driven Jeeps, Expeditions, and Honda CRVs. After driving SUVs for twenty years, I wanted something different but utilitarian. It's great... lots of room with fold-down seats. It handles so well, I hate to drive my husband's Mercedes E class as it's got so much more play and bigger turning radius. It feels so loose compared to responsiveness of my wagon. Got the AWD wagon for peace of mind. I was a Mercedes lover before this. Not anymore! </TEXT>

<TEXT>By far this is a great car. I live in Orange County, CA, it's my 2nd lease of a 3-series. One thing that bothers me is the tires that BMW decided to put on these cars. They Bridgstone Turanza EL 42 Model RFT (Run Flat Tires), it comes standard on all BMW. I have about 600 miles on the car and just had a nail on of the tires. BMW dealer would not patch this and tires are not part of warranty. Costs about $300/tire to get a new one each time you have a bad luck running over a nail. In addition, they last only about 10,000 - 15,000 without mileage warranty from Bridgestone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've just finished breaking in my 2008; this car is a thrill to drive. And this coming from a guy that used to drive only as a necessary evil! From front bumper to rear bumper, this car is first-class. It may cost a bit more than some, but trust me, the first time you accelerate to 130 mph on the Autobahn (or I guess you can't do that in the States) or take a tight corner, you'll be glad you spent the extra dollars! This is easily the #1 car in its class with US military in Germany, and that's against some stiff competition from Audi and the like. Throw in the warranty, and you can't go wrong! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, handling, both interior and exterior fit and finish. I can't feel any turbo lag. iDrive is actually pretty easy, have your dealer go through it during delivery. iPod/USB interface is great, and the heated seats are best ever--there are three temp settings for a reason! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a follow-up review to one I submitted recently on my 2008 335 xi coupe in which I gave it high marks. If you are considering this car be advised that you can only get RFTs (run flat tires). In addition the 18? five spoke wheels only come with summer performance RFTs. Note: there isn?t an all-season RFT available for the 18? wheel. If you are not familiar with RFTs be prepared for the following. RFTs give a much harder ride, cost about twice as much as conventional tires and may not be able to be fixed if you have a flat. The result of that will be a replacement tire costing $300 ? $350! I replaced the original RFTs on my 335xi Coupe with conventional high perf</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming to the 335xi coupe from a '00 328Ci, the 335xi is a more grown-up and far more powerful car. The engine lives up to its reputation and then some. Amazing low end torque - really does feel like a V8. This makes the 335xi a very different animal from the traditional BMW inline-6 car, and while quicker, it feels somewhat less sporting. With the old inline-6s (and presumably the new 328) you really had to spool up the engine. Now, you don't have to push it and if you do you're soon over the speed limit. Great fit and finish. The xi drive is fantastic in poor conditions, although the xi suspension is softer than in my old E46 (more body roll). All-in-all, very happy with it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine: Amazing power and sounds great. Xi drive: Makes the car a far more dependable commuter in poor weather. iDrive: Maybe there are other systems that are easier to use, but the integrated nav, iPod controller, phone is fantastic. Dynamic re-routing around traffic disruptions is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is easily the best car I have ever driven. The handling is amazing and the styling is great! It is truly fun to drive! The 328xi is a bit more sluggish when accelerating than the 328i, but the slight difference in performance is outweighed by the superior handling of the 328xi on icy/snowy roads. You won't be disappointed with this car, especially if you live in a place with harsh winters!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned many, and most recently test drove them all - G35, M35, 08 C- Class, TL, Audi A4 (2.0 & 3.2), A3 (3.2), Passat, A6, 530i (2005). Nothing even comes close to the feel of the BMW. If driving enjoyment is your top priority, this is your only choice (save the 5 series, but you'll spend a lot more). All are excellent cars, but the 335i has something extra that you have to drive to experience. No probs for me with the run flat tires</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded in my 07 Mercedes C230 sport for the 328xi sedan to have a car that gets around in our winter months. They are definitely 2 different cars. This car handles much tighter and feels stronger and more sporty. My husband is a big guy and fits so much better in the BMW. There is more space in the back seat, my 5 year old's feet really don't touch the front seat like in the mercedes. The thing I notice the most is that I can actually get in this car without hitting my side on the door strip. It's so much easier to get in and out of. Its a little higher off the ground than the mercedes. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With all of the horror stories regarding the ride on run-flat tires, BMW's finally done something about it. The suspension on the new 2008 335xi is light-years better than previous xis with RFTs. You must specify that the car be equipped with the Continental Conti Pro Contact tires NOT Bridgestones. This is my third xi, the second with RFTs and I am amazed at the difference. The power is amazing, the handling, of course is traditional BMW... stiff and responsive. This car is almost worth the price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one great car. I had owned a 2006 CTS and test drove the new CTS, a G35x an A4 and the entry level Lexus. Here's the thing: you need to know what you really want. If you really want the driving experience, you have to get the 335 if you can afford it. I was skeptical, but the reviews really are right, there's no comparison. Other cars (CTS) are bigger, others are maybe better value propositions (G35x), but none match the driving experience. I had high hopes for the G35x since its close on paper, but its much less civilized in real life and I feel still a ways behind. BMW downsides are price and the back seat is bit tight, but I have two kids in car seats and it works ok. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking at BMW xis vs the Infiniti AWDs and for the price the Infiniti packages seem like a better deal but overall, long term quality is not there. I spent the extra money and went with BMW. I traded a 300ci in for the 335xi. What an amazing car. I miss the sleekness of a coupe but this car is a rocket compared to the old 330ci. We had our first big snow fall and the car drove like a dream. I was really pushing it to see when it would slip or the rear would get loose and it was tight. This is a great car for someone who loves speed, excellent quality but lives in the midwest. It is worth every penny. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This awesome car is the complete package. It handles as well as my Porsche Boxster and has much more power. Yet it seats four, with comfort and with the top up is as quiet as a coupe. Luggage is limited with the top down, but more than enough with the top up. The ride is excellent and I have had no complaints on the run flats. The sport seats are infinitely adjustable and comfortable for long trips. We did not get iDrive and I am glad from what I have seen. The iPod option is great and much better deal than getting the cd changer. Get about 20 mpg around town and high 20's on the road. A little over 1500 miles and no problems. This car does everything well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>08 335i convertible, auto, nav, sirius, premium, back up sensors. Best option on the convertible is the wind blocker. Have had the top down at 105 mph and not had papers on the front seat move! Keeps the interior warm with the heat on at 50 degrees. Top is cool, seat heaters are actually too powerful. IDrive works fine, in some cases better than wife's Lexus system. Power is incredible. 20 mph in mixed driving with a heavy foot. I've had it about a month and put 1700 miles on it. Definitely will buy extended warranty and extended service contract. Traded 02 Lexus for this and am happy. Not as smooth as the Lexus, but I wanted a more sporty ride and more power. Got both and more. </TEXT>

<TEXT>2008 335xi, 4 door titanium silver. Premium, cold weather, navigation, iPod adapter, manual. Hands down the best car I've ever driven. Test drove the TL, G35X, C Class and 328xi before deciding on the 335xi. Other models driving experience just does not compare. 328xi was nice, but the power of the 335xi is night & day different and worth the extra money, especially with the additional standard options. In hindsight, I wish I got the sport package in addition to or instead of the navigation. So far I've put 2200 miles on this vehicle and have had zero problems with it. Overall I'm very satified with this vehicle, although it can get very expensive with all the options. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>POWER! Twin turbos. Neck snappingly fast. Insanely fun to drive. Sound of the exhaust and motor at 5,000 RPMS. All wheel drive. Bluetooth and voice recognition.

<TEXT>This car has fantastic handling. It is well-balanced, and the steering reacts almost immediately. The interior is well-designed, although iDrive is still a pain. I have the convertible, and, if I had to do it over again, I would not buy this car. The miniscule trunk with the top down makes it impossible to run even minor errands. I cannot even remove my tennis racket without going through the machinations of putting the top up. Even more frustrating is the harsh ride inflicted by the run-flat tires. I changed mine to regular go-flat tires one week after purchase, and the ride improved immeasurably. Overall, a nice car, but the trunk space and run-flats ruin the experience.</TEXT>

This car inspires confidence like nothing I have ever driven before and my wife and I are constantly finding reasons just to get out and drive the car down our favorite back roads.

<TEXT>This car handles like a dream. The interior is nice, and the turbo spools up so fast you don't even notice it. It is very easy to drive this car extremely fast. However, I have a few major gripes. First, why only run-flats BMW. They are terrible. They give a rough ride, are noisy, and wear poorly. I will never by a BMW again - or any other car for that matter - with run-flats! Next issue, there is absolutely zero trunk space. Forget about even a carry-on, it will not fit. This is unacceptable. Final issue, the iDrive is still confusing. All in all, a great driving car, but upon reflection, I would probably not buy again because of the run-flats and the trunk issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the 335xi coupe which the dealer just brought in (a day before) for test-drive purposes, this all-wheel-drive series just came out in October. My car is fully equipped with sport, premium, and cold weather package as well as the navigation. The color is space gray. The total cost is around $55000. I've only driven it for a week now, the handling is superb. I drove it through the rain on Saturday (Noel in the northeast), when making turns on slippery road, you can feel the car is sticking to the road. The xenon headlights are really great.

After 1200 miles it is surprisingly fast and fun to drive on German roads (B-50 near Nürburgring) more than what I expected from a car. Very stable at 145 MPH on Autobahn. Good stereo, easy to clean wheels, hate the in and out of the vehicle (med. male 170 lbs driver) and steering wheel tilt stinks, must get iPod option when buying or pay 3x more when dealer installed after, average of 21 MPG so far on premium fuel, new for 08 white LED for door and license plate, only a fender side repeater lens with water condensation problem that is being replaced by dealer warranty so far.

<TEXT>I recently traded in my '03 M3 coupe for the 2008 335xi coupe and I have no regrets. From my perspective the 335 does everything well and is a pleasure to drive. It has driving dynamics close to a M3 but with a more refined ride. Combine this with the all-season capability of BMW's x-drive and you have a sport coupe that just may be the perfect car in this segment. The bottom line: if you want a race car buy one. The new M3, a Corvette or a Porsche will do the job. If on the other hand you want a grown-up sports coupe that has room for four, can carry luggage and golf clubs, test drive the 335xi coupe.

<TEXT>No regrets in choosing the sweet sounding naturally aspirated I6 over the turbo - plenty of acceleration throughout the power band matched to exceptional road feel. The GM 6-speed transmission is not as refined as the ZF, but still head and shoulders over any other auto that I have owned. DS mode and paddles provide plenty of flexibility and fun. AWD is sure-footed in rain and snow, and the xi is the perfect match for urban/suburban roads. 8K well-spent in options (ZPP, ZSP, Xenon, CA, iPod, Heated Seats, Metallic Paint). Phenomenal build quality with no issues to date - just a smile every minute behind the wheel!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned the vehicle for a year, although I'm storing it for the winter, and couldn't love it more. The performance and handling are outstanding (unless you try to drive in 1/2" of snow with the Sports Package). If you really want to have fun with it I highly recommend installing the Dinan Performance Engine Software upgrade. For $2k you can increase the power output to 384hp and the torque to 421lb-ft (and Dinan will match BMW's new car warranty). It's no M but honestly it's plenty fast and nimble for quite a bit less cash. It's sporty and fun when you want it to be yet still smooth and refined.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first BMW and my only regret is that I waited this long to buy it. I think of it as a jewelbox: small and compact, but very well constructed. It's the perfect personal luxury car for those who like to drive. There's nothing flashy about it, other than the badge, yet it still gets looks. Although some of the controls appear counterintuitive at first, most of the driving-related controls are well thought out, and make sense after you understand the reason behind their design. I'm very pleased with the quietness and comfort for the front seats, although if you are a large/tall person, you might need to look at a 5- series.

<TEXT>Just turned in an Audi S4 sedan for this 335xi sedan. Have been driving it for 4 months. After hearing about how great BMW is for it's superior "driving experience" I have been somewhat disappointed in this car. The steering and handling are average at best. The car does not corner well - there is significant body roll and the steering is not tight. I am not sure if this is due to the runflat tires or maybe I should have gotten the M3, but then no AWD. The engine is great, probably quicker off the line than my Audi, but not as strong once you're at speed and need to accelerate. The gas mileage is also good. The cup holders are a joke.

<TEXT>Gas mileage on long trips (Pgh to DC and back) is 30 mpg (average over 10 trips, 29 one way, 31 the other)! All is well except for nav system and iDrive and their integration, and no spare. Get a Garmin instead of BMW nav system which is a Navtec base. Garmin says "In 500 ft make a rt on route 123 South" - if you use the Australian lady enunciation. Navtec says "make the next right". Garmin shows road names on perspective view, Navtec doesn't. iDrive requires too many actions for usage, and interupts other audio as it drones out it's directions. Also, I plan to replace RFTs with GFTs when they wear out and lug a spare around in the trunk. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent handling, acceleration, and fuel economy. The iDrive control system takes a few days to master, but eventually becomes second nature and results in a very relaxing drive. Interior is properly designed. Quality shows inside and out. Well designed and tested interior materials. Standard sound system is great. Navigation system option should be selected if possible because of the iDrive system being included. One knob beside the right armrest is all you use to navigate through the options/music/nav/communication/climate, etc. Exterior looks beautiful. Folding mirrors are nice and the tires fit the wheel wells perfectly. I love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purposely waited a few months to write a review so I could experience the car a little bit. I have had the car for 2 months now and it has not disappointed. There is no question I would prefer the HP of the 335 better but this car is a great combination of performance, driving dynamics and comfort. I was coming from a G35 and this car is definitely put together better and doesn't feel as cheap (because it isn't!!). Compared it to everything else in the same class and it is a bit more expensive, but so far, it was worth it. Run flats do make the ride a bit rough. I have the 6spd and I am getting roughly 20 mpg in the city - Not bad and very important these days.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sport seats, iPod integration, handling and road feel, shifter and pivoting headlights. Build quality is great - car feels extremely solid.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Handles well, and looks good, but the radio fades in and out (known BMW problem, but no fix at this time) and I can't read the radio when wearing polarized sun glasses. I asked the dealership about this and they said BMW knows about it, but no fix. I was shocked that BMW would build a car with a radio that we can't read the radio dials when wearing polarized sun glasses. I never had this problem with prior cars. Also, the Jet black paint scratches too easily.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I hesitated before purchasing the 328i. In fact, I opted for a 2007 MB C230 Sport for my wife after test driving the then-new 335i in 2006. Realistically, I do not see how a daily commute needs 300+ hp. The 328i provides adequate handling even w/o the sport(y) package when compared to the RX8 I traded in. Unfortunately, the 16" runflat all-seasons are a poor compromise. Highway expansion joints are much more noticeable than the MB. The MB has 17" performance tires w/ lower profile. BMW also worked diligently on cost-cutting when packaging the E90. Where is the standard alarm? Where is the jack? How about a real cup holder? Still, the 328i puts a smile on my face every morning.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up the car this past march. It was sitting in the lot, so the sales person gave us the car for invoice price, so I couldn't resist the offer. Got the car in monaco blue on beige. Absolutely gorgeous. The car is a beast, even though it goes 0-60 in 5.7 secs, give or take, you'll outrun 90% of the cars on the road. Gas mileage is superb as well, averaging 24 mpg with mixed driving. I just filled up my car and I have 440 miles on a full tank. If you're looking for a fun and somewhat economical car, the 335i is it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Handling is awesome. Power is incredible. I tried the DS mode and the steptronic and car left in a hurry. Fuel economy so far is about 24 MPG 75%/25% highway/city. Seems to do badly in stop and go traffic. Test drove a C300, IS250, and C230. BMW was far superior in all categories. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned an '07 Cayman S. This car is a beautiful compromise between a sports car and a luxury car. It is tight, fast, and comfortable. It is easy to drive. The gas mileage is surprisingly good if driven conservatively. I was leery about the run-flats, but I have to say I don't notice a harsh ride or excess noise (especially compared to the ride of the Porsche in sport mode, with conventional tires). The options do push the price up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance of the twin turbo engine. Stereo. Good looks. Crisp shifts when driven in sport mode. The readability of the dash/nav in bright light is excellent. I actually like the cupholders.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car is fun to drive, but unreliable at times. In my opinion, this car has a fuel management problem. Don't like the run flats, but oh well. Recommend waiting two more years until BMW works out the bugs or you'll be spending more time in the shop than expected. Have a second car available. Lease, do not buy this car so you can get a good feel for the car until you are ready to buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first BMW and am really glad I got the convertible. I'm in San Diego where the weather is great year round; dropping the top on my new 335i enhances the fun of this great car. It's a speeding ticket waiting to happen. Watch out CHP! The performance is spectacular. It's a real beauty and it turns heads. Mine is alpine white with cream beige leather seats - very classy looking. I purchased the PermaPlate to protect the paint and the leather seats. Especially good investment for a convertible as the seats have more exposure to the elements - the car looks great all the time. Driving in sport mode is great fun on mountain roads - truly exhilarating. This car rates high on the fun meter!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Terrific audio system. Heated seats are great. Adjustable seats are very comfortable. Also, love being able to start the car without having to use a key - the comfort access is a must-have feature. Interior ambient lighting is very cool looking! Retractable side mirrors are a great feature. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently traded my 2003 325i for a 2008 328i. This is no "luxury-boat," but it is a head-turner. I bought this car because my 325i was almost perfect for 5 1/2 years. BMWs have strong bloodlines, and if you see a six year old BMW on the street, you know what it is. I got the Sports package, 6 speed manual, leatherette, and little else because the car comes so well equipped. I like the wood grain dash, although it looks a little shiny and plastic. This car seems a little bigger and more.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like almost everything about the car. The six speed manual transmission is smooth and has a nice short throw. In 6th, the car lopes along at 80. The slightly larger size and power is nice. Even the leatherette looks good and is easy to keep clean.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd 3-series (2002 325i, 2006 325i, now my 2008 328i Coupe) and I can say that I have been a loyal, dedicated customer of BMW. The cars are so wonderful once you buy one you can't buy or drive any other make. It feels like a part of you physically as you drive the car, from the structure to the brakes to the steering and engine the feeling is so terrific and reassuring other makes feel like appliances in comparison or clouds to drive (i.e. Lexus). BMW sure has created a car worthy of master craftsmanship that will have longevity in the marketplace for years to come if they keep up the wonderful effort in producing such a wonderful product!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>So many to name, from the seats (sport pkg) to the engine (smooth and musical) to the steering to the styling of the coupe that turns heads even in LA when my car is a dime a dozen. Its truly a wonderful, complete design that truly speaks of BMW's heritage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is easily the best car I've ever owned, in every aspect. It's beautiful to look at both in and out, and I now understand why the BMW Client Advisors talk about BMW luxury being built around the performance. Performance first, luxury second. It's true. I've owned many Mercedes (all used, admittedly) and this car replaces a stolen, top-of-the-line, completely optioned Jetta 2.0T, which had been the most sophisticated car I'd owned, and the Bimmer outshines them all in every conceivable way. I have premium, steptronic, xenon, iPod, comfort access, alpine white with special lemon/dakota leather.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently picked up my 328i Sedan with Sport and Cold Weather Packages and as with the other BMWs in my family am supremely impressed. BMW still is able to capture that essential quality that makes a car the Ultimate Driving Machine. From the good gas mileage to the silky smooth 6-spd manual, the 328i with sport package captures BMW's excellent handling characteristics at a relatively affordable price. All in all I am hugely impressed with the 328i and would in fact take the weight savings and naturally aspirated engine over the turbo motor (having only owned naturally aspirated BMWs in the past and having a very bad experience with a 1986 745i Turbo).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wanted a convertible; got a rocket ship without a roof. The 305 hp engine mated with a 6 speed ZF auto trany is a masterwork -- smooth power and precise shifts in all situations. The 3-part roof is a miracle of modern engineering; owning it out of warranty would scare me (est $20k+ repl. cost). My biggest gripe on the roof is it leaks in pressure car washes; even so it is dry in rain and quiet on the road. Sound system is ok, and clear even with the top down. The standard (non-sport) seats are excellent, with fantastic seat heaters. Gripes: car without sport package is mushy in the corners. Run flat tires are a stupid joke. Interior fit/finish not great. A/C weakish. 16 mpg city.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driving with the roof down / the comfort access feature to lower the roof from key. With the optional wind blocker for the back seat (a must buy) you can hear the radio, not feel blown away, and have a conversation with the top down up to 80 mph +. It should be illegal to drive with the roof up.</FAVORITE>

A lot of comments were made regarding the run flats- they are for purpose and safety but I think they make for a smooth ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought it without a test drive. And already over 4K miles on it after just 3 months of driving (can't put the keys down). My first BMW, and I'm very satisfied. Found out after buying it that the wife wasn't going to drive it so I should have gone for the 335xi or the coupe (but there's always next year). Handles very nicely even with the run flats (see note below). Nice solid feel while in motion. Power is good for my driving environment (mostly city). So the extra horses of the 335 would go mostly unused except for the occasional weekend drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, iPod interface, folding mirrors (I park in a tight, dark garage at work), and the auto/manual transmission. The "backup" sensor has also saved me a few times from wall to bumper interaction (also due to the above mentioned garage).</FAVORITE>

This was an indulgence and we don't regret it a bit! Car is Monaco (midnight) blue, tan leather, Premium Pkg, iDrive, Sirius, iPod, auto and cold weather package. The car doesn't have the Sport Package, and IMHO doesn't need it. In fact, I think it makes the ride more comfortable. The most fun is when you need to step on it a little to pass somebody or enter a freeway. The power is immediate, the handling is precise and secure. It's just plain fun!

But hands down, BMW is definitely the ultimate driving machine. Kudos to BMW with the hardtop design.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second BMW and let me tell you, BMW has made some huge upgrades. Three years ago I owned a 330i sedan w/ M inspired performance package. This car is way better on so many levels. For starters the 300 hp engine is very powerful. In third gear I'm already at 100 mph. This car is FAST! Also, the color options are great. I choose sparkling graphite w/ coral red leather. The interior and exterior designs are very pleasing to the eye. Great options are available like the iPod connection, comfort access, and rear park distance alert. Another cool feature is the ability to retract the side mirrors automatically with a push of button. Overall, this is a great car that I highly recommend!</TEXT>

A large suitcase fits sideways under the top spacer along with my wife's makeup case and odds and ends. Plenty for a long weekend. My biggest gripe is with BMW making a decent iPod connection and sat radio an option. On a car in this price range in today's world, these should be standard. The wheels are ok, almost "boring".

<TEXT>Automatic with paddle shifters, sports package, Navigation, Cold Weather Package, IPod adapter. Wow this car is fast, I smoked a late model Trans Am while trying to pass on the freeway. I decided to upgrade to a new performance chip, adding an additional 60 HP! I love coming up next to another 335i and seeing the look on their face in my rearview mirror with I pull away from them! As you can imagine, I get crappy gas mileage but since I travel so much and only drive my car mostly on the weekends, I only refill my tank every couple of weeks. I see a lot of complaints about the iDrive system but if you read the manual and learn the voice commands, it makes it much more usable. Thank you BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First BMW and we wish we had purchased one sooner. This is a great car with no glaring weaknesses. I'm confused about the reviews on the trunk space. We can put a medium size (larger than carry on) suitcase and my wife's makeup case and other odds and ends under the "top down" space divider with no problem. More than enough space for a long weekend for 2. If we went with soft sided luggage, it would be even better. We have Nav, Cold Weather, Premium, Sport and Comfort access packages. In today's world, Sirius, iPod and windblocker should come standard. This is our only complaint with BMW being so cheesy in this price range.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was considering the following cars Accord V6, Lexus IS 250, Audi A4 2.0T Quattro and the BMW 328i. I'm an engineer by profession and have studied these cars extensively. My suggestion to anyone that is looking for a performance oriented car looking to purchase one, don't go by the bhp, rather look for torque and the rpm it is generated at. No regrets buying the BMW, its immaculate. No wonder it is the benchmark of its segment. Rear wheel drive gives a great sporty feel, avoid the all wheel drive. If you want AWD, buy the Audi. The quattro is far better than the xi models of BMW. BMW's got amazing gear ratios, an engine that responds at cruising rpm to accelerations and it sure turns heads!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sports tuned suspension, high performance tires, high torque at low rpm, drop dead gorgeous looks esp with the fog lamps on at night.

<TEXT>I have been reading reviews and have been driving BMWs for years now but despite how good everyone said this car would be it doesn't sink in until you pull it off the lot. I traded in an E46 M3 so there was a lot this car had to live up to. I couldn't believe that this car feels just as fast as my old M3 but is much easier to drive. The feel of the car is just as good but it handles the rough stuff way better. I need to mention something that has been a sore point for many reviewers but if you are at all computer literate, the iDrive will be a MUST have. There will be a learning curve but the technology integration is way better than many reviewers give it credit for. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car except for 2 things: 1) It is sluggish off the line unless you use sport mode on the tranny. Not that big a deal, but annoying. 2) I HATE the run flat tires. They are noisy, stiff and leave too many uncertanties. If you get a flat, you drive on it and basically trash the tire and have to replace it. I hate these and am looking to replace all of them and buy a spare. Problem is, there is no place to put the spare, except to eat up trunk space. BMW, make these pieces of crap an option, not std. Buy the car, love it, but negotiate for them to swap tires. You will be glad you did.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning 4 previous BMWs including my most recent, a fully loaded 06 530i, I was a bit hesitant in going back to a 3 series. Not any longer! They have substantially upgraded the 3s and with the premium, sport and navi system which I opted for, I do not even remotely miss my 5. This car has so much power and is extremely fun to drive! I love it! The retractable hardtop is a show stopper everywhere I go. Even with the top up, the car is amazing. Very quiet while driving, even at interstate speed! My only complaint is the exhaust note. It sort of sounds like one of the cars from "The Fast and Furious." Not exactly the sound I expected from a luxury convertible.</TEXT>

The twin-turbo engine, build quality and design are truly exceptional. I highly recommend this car to driving enthusiasts who truly appreciate automotive excellence.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Highly refined exterior and interior, world class motor, excellent sound system, designed to take the "twisties" with authority! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My new 08 335i is is all BMW promised that it would be in the performance area, however, the Rubiconian iDrive that no one seems to like is frustrating at best. This sadistic torture device should be put in a museum of failed technology. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this vehicle almost one year now and I really do like it. My biggest concern revolves around, when does technology outpace the needs of the average driver. Building a car that requires the buyer to only frequent BMW for service is smart on their part but when does that backfire ? That being said, the car has been problem free and is still the best handling car I've ever owned. To do it all over again... maybe Audi A4 next time. After an exhaustive search for a new vehicle it was neck and neck with the BMW.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design, dash lay out, firm seats which are quickly heated in the winter, great acceleration and fabulous brakes.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Our problem was living in the city and not wanting to drive a big car, yet going to the country house and having to carry all the stuff, golf clubs, suit cases etc. Turning radius is also very important in the city. The wagon does it all with ease. I love the keyless ignition and heated seats are a must. It's the only small car that has this kind of appointments and space without getting an SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After waiting over 20 years, I finally purchased my first BMW and it has been everything I've ever wanted. The turbo charged engine is what ultimately sold me the 335 over the 328. Living in a city with steep winding hills I wanted a car that I could depend on to deliver the necessary power and handling and the 335xi delivers. I bought the car for the driving experience it provides, nothing more! If you want fancier gadgets then buy a lexus, but if you want the top of the line driving car, then you have to buy the BMW!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love just about everything with the car! The powerful turbo charged engine and the tight handling top the list. But I love the rain sensing wipers, the satelite radio, the heated seats, and the blue tooth just to name a few!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I live in New Hampshire. We just experienced the snowiest winter in 135 years of record keeping! I got this car on 12/31/07, what perfect timing!! I cannot say enough about how impressive this car is. The Xdrive system was engineered for exactly what weather we experienced this winter. I felt so confident every trip I took in absolutely terrible weather conditions. Aside from the obvious top notch winter weather performance, this car with all the bells and whistles (nav, iPod, prem. pkg, cold pkg, steptronic) is so much fun to drive! It's scary fast! The 328xi is nice, but this car is awesome! I highly recommend getting all the options I did. You will not be disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this over the competion for a 4 door AWD sedan. I will have to get winter run-flat booties, but that is a minor inconvenience. My daughter runs iDrive like a pro, without reading the manual. It is not nearly as bad as most of the auto rags make it out to be. the cup holders are kinda wonky, but there really is nowhere else to put em. Keyless entry is the way to go. I have the sports package and the seats are great. The engine is a piece of art. The gas mileage is about the same as was my former AWD Volvo, and more that 80hp more power. Fit and finish is top shelf. The stereo is great, and quite flat in audio response. Car is very quiet, except when you boot it, and hear that engine!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It handles like no other car in its class. The acceleration is pretty impressive. The iPod interface is a real good feature. Bluetooth is a great feature. I like it so much I don't even mind the gong for seatbelts and doors ajar. The run flats are not as bad as some have suggested.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never thought I would describe a BMW as a great value but boy was I wrong. After shopping Audi, Infiniti, Acura and Lexus I found the 328i to offer a great driving experience for the money. While the competion often out horsepowered the 3 liter 230 hp BMW powerplant, none offered even comparable handling or ride. To allow owning 2 cars (my second is a Boxster S) I kept the options on my BMW everyday driver at a minimum (leather/power seats). The standard features offered provided plenty of luxury for a sports sedan with the interior offering beauty through simplicity. Most importantly, I really enjoy driving this car! Do yourself a favor, before buying another sports sedan drive a BMW. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded up from previous 04 Saab. Car is best on open road and takes turns like on rails. car not best for city commuting, does not like to go slow and has slow idle speed. Top down car stays toasty with great heat. Pretty soon see how cool it stays with AC on and top down. Did not get sport package and have no harsh ride, think it is the sport tires rather than run-flats that does gives stiff ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car. Bought premium, sport, and nav packages. Didn't really want iPod kit or xenon headlights but love that I got them. Wanted iDrive more for computer control of functions than for GPS but like the GPS capability, especially searching for nearby businesses. More sport than others I considered, such as Merc-300 sport, Audi A4 & A6. You will feel the road, corners and bumps so if you drive bad roads take that into consideration. Corners great and acceleration is plenty for most. Standard sound system is great for my non-audiofile ears. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>BMW paid great attention to little things, such as tilting passenger side mirror in reverse, cruise control indicator on speedometer, highly adjustable seats, programmable automatic ventilation when engine is off (hot day in sun), good gas mileage for class, ventilated center storage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent car! A little pricey for size and power but it handles like no other car. Comfort access is a must have and so, too, is split fold down seats. Only problem with car is warning triangle came on twice which the dealer fixed. Test drove IS 350 and though the Lexus has more power, it was way too small and confining. BMW gets a nudge on handling as well. If you got for just basic car w\sports package, you are getting a hell of a car for about the same as a Chrysler or high end Ford. No comparison. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The day you get to pick it up, you will never be the same after driving such a great car. Handling, speed, gas mileage, fun to drive is on top of the list. I never thought driving could be so much fun, I hate my 2 hr commute to work but now it's actually fun to drive. I highly recommend the vehicle, the base model is good enough but if you can afford it get the fully loaded bad boy! Love my BMW! Great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A very well built car. Although the 328 does not have the engine performance of the 335i or the Infiniti G37 it is still more than adequate for very fast bursts of speed. The car is comfortable and the handling is crisp, tight and predictable. You can feel that a great deal of thought has gone into the design. I believe that the 3-series is still the benchmark and very much the dominant player in its market. The iDrive system takes an hour or so to get used too and is not that complicated in my opinion. Overall I am more than satisfied and have no regrets.</TEXT>

<TEXT>New BMW owner, previously owned Japanese models (Acura, Toyota, Mazda). Very pleased, wonderful car to drive. Scary fast, with great pick up in any gear. The finish and technology are exceptional. I'm very pleased with the choice. Test drove Infiniti G37, but didn't make it out of the BMW dealer after test driving the 335xi (got it on the spot). Didn't go for the nav, bought a Garmin nuvi (noticed BMW also sells Garmins with the BMW branding).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine - oh my is it fast! x-drive just sticks to the road, bad weather is not concerning at all (no snow driving yet though). iPod integration, the robot arm that hands you your seatbelt, the on board monitoring and built-in assist service, the sport seats, just about everything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a sports coupe but needed 4 doors so I compromised and bought the 335i sedan. With 300hp and tons of torque, it's the best of both worlds. It is unbelievably fast, yet can handle the chores and hum-drum driving of daily life. Going from 60-120 mph is effortless and so easy that I have to keep reminding myself I can't drive this way in the U.S. (Thankfully, I live in Germany at the moment). Whenever I want to put a smile on my face, all I have to do is prod the pedal and hold on till the speed quickly reaches triple digits. I drove the G35, Benz, Audi, and the Volvo. They were nice cars but this one is great. I have no regrets. The 335i is the ultimate sports sedan, bar none!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I originally was thinking of buying the 328i but when I drove the 335i, all logic flew out the window. The 300hp, twin turbo engine makes this car what it is. Thinking of passing a car? No waiting, it happens right now! Instantaneous, smooth, powerful, and ridiculously scary in how fast it is.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was going to buy a G35 but thanks to limited headroom and no help from Infiniti to improve headroom, I picked the 328i. What a machine... ordered from the factory with Prem, Sport, Xenon, Comfort Access about a month ago and I've been smiling ever since. Razor like handling, & ample power. The traction control works VERY well on wet or slushy WA roads -- no regrets for passing up the xi. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, rock solid chasis ( like a German bank vault!), engine, headlights, traction control,comfort access (look Ma - no keys!),and the wonderful feel and smell of that leather! Best of all - no high pressure add on sales pitch from the finance manager!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been very impressed so far after taking delivery of my new 328xi. The tight cornering, quick acceleration, and solid feel are the best selling points. BMW USA and my local dealer have treated me like royalty! The exterior styling is not over-the-top, but elegant and bordering on conservative. The performance and power are exceptional. The advanced technology is not overwhelming - it just works. I am very happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The DSC and DTC plus other active control features are incredible. The bluetooth integration and adjustable seating features are also favorites. The driver can select which features to activate and can fine tune most settings.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have about 7800 miles on my 328xi red wagon. I love it! It's the most reliable car I've had, has great space for the size and navigation system and Sirius radio rock! Navigation disses are silly. It's as easy to learn as an iPod which I love, and probably should be standard. Cupholders seem weird at first, but are okay. Comfort access is a great safety feature, and so is all-wheel drive. Gas mileage better than sticker. Drives like a BMW. Enough said. It's my first, but I've had Mercedes and such. Never anything but BMW from here on out. Get one. You will fall in love. I promise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did not think that paying the extra money for the BMW over the infinit, acura, lexus, etc would really be worth it. I was so very wrong, this car drives and rides so much better then anything I have ever owned. I had the chance to drive back to back the M35 2 weeks after I got my 335i (brand new rental) and wow, I loved the M35 until I owned the BMW. If you are considering any of those cars, you will not be disappointed in the 335i sedan. Impressed is an understatement.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine would have to be near the top of the list, smooth seamless power from 2000 all the way to red line. I have owned many cars and have never owned one that would just continue to pull no matter what gear you are in like this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Living in the Ohio Snow Belt I wanted Xi system. I went with the 335 Xi, 6 speed and truly love all the performance and handling. I ordered extra wheels for snow tires, Continentals, which have been great. I?ve found the winter capability to be nothing short of fantastic. I?m anxious to put the OEM tires back on once the winter is over. Build quality, material quality is far above any other vehicle I have owned. On trips I've gotten 26+MPG at 70 MPH. </TEXT>

I finally ordered a BMW 328i w/ 6MT, Sports, Premium, and Xenons... a pretty basic car in my mind as BMW tends to nickel and dime you for basics in a luxury sedan, i.e. leather seats, power seats, xenon headlamps. Although BMW is relatively the most expensive, the handling is definitely the best for an entry-level luxury sedan.</TEXT>
