<AUTHOR>Not happy in Florida</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This RDX has been a nightmare. I have been in the shop 12 times since purchasing - 4 times for brakes alone. I've had them cleaned, replaced, rotors and then completely redone again. My memory module has gone, my seat has stopped working, blue tooth stopped working, bubbles on the hood from the paint, everything down to the footrest has fallen off. The rattle in the windows is terrible. Trying to get corporate to take back (WISH ME LUCK). The only good thing about this vehicle is the turbo.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Buy this car with your eyes wide open and your expectations in line - you'll be happy. Reading the previous reviews for the RDX, I wonder whether some simply chose the wrong car. Don't buy a race horse, and then complain that it eats too much or can't pull a loaded wagon. This turbocharged engine has its quirks, but drive it right and you'll be rewarded with decent mileage and good acceleration. About 21-22 if driven moderately. Is it noisy? A slight growl when floored. How about road noise? Depends on the road. Texas chip-and-seal roads get a little tiresome, but interstates are pretty quiet, and low-to-moderate speed roads are no problem. For me it's the right car - I'm happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ESS sound system is the best, the SH-AWD is simply superb, paddle-shifter, information display, reserved luxurious interior, front seats, headlights, driving position, fold-down rear seats. The iPhone and this Bluetooth implementation are seamless. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Where do I start? Sure this vehicle is "fun to drive" and handles like a dream, and the interior is full of nifty features, like bluetooth, the Nav system and the phenomenal sound system. But that's about it!! Everything else about this vehicle is simply the worst. The turbo-4 is VERY NOISY when accelerating, and a good amount of ROAD NOISE enters the cabin. Very tiring on long highway drives!! FUEL ECONOMY is HORRENDOUS (about 15city/20hwy)- A huge disappointment for such a small 4-cylinder SUV!! (and for the most part I don't even drive very aggressively). I wish I could just return it and get something else!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I actually like this car, it handles well and has a lot of nice features. I have 23 months to go on my lease and will not purchase again. Too many rattles for a car at this price range. The gas mileage is horrible especially in the city, 17 mpg. I have taken it in twice and they seemed to fix one rattle but the other is still VERY audible. Overall somewhat disappointed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable seats similar to my Volvo. Easy to read controls. Rear seats very easy to fold down and good cargo space for a car this size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It has almost been a year since I bought the RDX. I was impressed by the kick from the turbo and the Acura reputation in *quality* etc. It all started with the rattles, squeaks and then somehow the turbo lost its zing. Got the rattle on the tail gate fixed. The dealer said that he has seen this with other RDXs as well. The driver's door has an intermittent issue with some sort of flapping sound and an even more infrequent window glass rattle. The dashboard in front of the steering has an infrequent noise coming in. It gets more regular and easier to hear when the sun is out and at low speeds. The zing from the turbo and the acceleration is missing out recently - should have gone for infinity</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove every car in its class before I decided to buy the RDX. I wanted something smaller than the gas guzzling Cayenne Turbo I was driving. I wanted good visibility, good handling and reasonable fuel mileage and a vehicle I can put my golf clubs without folding down the back seats, which the Porsche, Audi, MB Ml all fail. The RDX has good acceleration and if you use the paddle shifter it beats just about any Suv at the stop light grand prix. The handling leaves the X3 for dead. Only negatives is the brakes. Several high speed stops in succession will cause the pads to vibrate. Dealer has replaced rotors and pads for free and admits it a problem. Also, nav screen is not bright</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats are great. I'm in the car sometime 3 to 4 hours a day and no fatigue. Handling is better than most SUV's and the reliability is fantastic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A great little SUV! It outperforms my G35X in the harshest winter conditions and is more fun to drive. My only "complaint" is that I wish it had a little more cargo space; but then I guess it would have been the MDX. The interior is beautiful, the features and tech outstanding. And I LOVE the XM Satellite radio! A great car! My wife loves it and I love driving it when she's not.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had the car for 8 months and drove wonderfully. Then, it snowed and my car had no brakes. I would miss stop signs, traffic lights, etc. 3 wheels ago, I got in a car accidents because the brakes fail to operate. I had taken it to the dealership and complained but they indicated that some ppl have had issues but there isn't much they can do about it. I filed a complaint at the corporate office but they brushed the matter off as if it was nothing. Beware when purchasing the vehicle. Not every car gets tested for snow, rain and gravel. this is a matter of life and death, for you and others on the road with you. I am in the process of a law suit with Acura. Good Luck to all!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the RDX for about three months and have been very pleased. I drove a Honda Pilot for 5 years and it did a great job of hauling kids, but driving it was kind of like driving a boat. Not so with the RDX. This little SUV handles better than my wife's TL but offers a lot more flexibility. I'm getting about 20 mpg in mixed driving, which is about what I expected. I could probably get better mileage if I kept the little red turbo needle pointing down more often, but where's the fun in that! So far, a really nice car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having spent a year and 13,000 miles with my RDX, I'm very pleased with the experience. After driving European sport sedans for the past 20 years, I wanted the utility, AWD, and taller view of a compact SUV. However, I didn't want to give up the "fun to drive" nature of my previous vehicles. The RDX delivers. It's very quick. And the ride is somewhat firm -- what I expected and wanted in a vehicle that enjoys attacking mountain curves. Yet, to me the ride is by no means harsh. The interior is well designed and fairly luxurious. Acura reliability is a huge bonus -- I got to know the service techs far too well with my previous cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought an RDX Tech package. This is primarily a commuter vehicle and a second car, so I was debating about getting a sedan for the gas mileage. I really like SUVs though, and this one is spot on the money -- fun to drive, higher ride height, good performance, decent space. I had a BMW x3 and 3 series sedan, and I like this better than either of those cars. Each time I drive it, I get a smile on my face (hearing the turbo whoosh is a blast). I just wish it got a bit better mileage. Previous cars also include an MDX (previous body style). This is way better than that car in tightness, comfort, luxury, and technology.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow! For the money the RDX really delivers. I think of it as a cross between the TL Type S and the MDX. Power is ample and the turbo makes it fun. Grip, hold, and road feel are spot on. The RDX makes you feel like you are attached to the pavement with no chance to ever come loose. Acura, as they tend to do, has really invested a LOT in the technology and engineering that you will never see. From the SH-AWD to the first of its kind dual stage turbo. So far, we are really impressed with the RDX.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had this car for 2 weeks, and both my wife and I love it so far. Turbo works great, giving you the extra boost when needed and staying "asleep" while you are just cruising along the highway. The RDX handles much better than the 2002 Honda Accord V6 we used to drive. The car is truly loaded with features. To pick a few: the navigation system knows your speed and gives you correct instructions even while the satellites are obstructed; the HUGE center storage keeps the glove box free of regular clutter (radar detector, Garmin nav) and has enough space for my wife's purse; voice recognition correctly understands our accented English; homelink replaces the ugly garage door remote.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Worked as a vehicle test engineer for an European car company when I fell in love with the SH-AWD system on the RL. Got the RDX based in July of 2007. Handling is light and responsive for a car with this huge mass. Turning corners is a dream with the SH-AWD: it ate corners while driving down I-80 near Lake Tahoe, CA. Turbo lag is small compared to other turbo cars but you can hear them. Durability has been excellent. People all comment how pricey this car looks and become surprised at the price. Very comfortable seats. Love the relatively large width of the vehicle. Rear seat space is very large for people of two, even three. Lament that I did not get the nav system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love everything about the car. In the beginning I was disappointed in the gas mileage (~16MPG) but now that I've learned how to drive less aggressively, I'm getting 24 to 27 MPG in a mix of city/highway. The trick is to stay out of boost and under 70MPH on the highway, sure it takes patience but I've gone from 260 miles per tank to just under 400... that's a savings of about $150 per month based on the 1800 miles per month I drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling: Amazing what a set of 20x8 wheels and 275/40-20 tires + Eibach Pro-kit 1.3" lowering springs can do for the handling...feels like it's on rails, almost Corvette-like. Gas Mileage: see above, averaging 26MPG. Honda reliability: haven't had ANY problems and I'm sure I wont (my 15th Honda).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Checked out the Nissan Murano and BMW X3...Saved about $5k in regards to the Murano and $10k in regards to the X3 by opting for the RDX. This car is worth every cent...luxury, yet it feels like driving a sports car. Navigation/AcuraLink is fabulous and the best one out there. Definitely check it out before saying "I'll just buy a Garmin". Its worth the upgrade in price. Only negative is the gas mileage, I have 500 miles on the car and average about 14.4 mpg. The good thing is that my commute is only 2 miles each way to work so its not too bad. If you're in the market for something in this market, definitely be sure to check the RDX out..its so much fun to own. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The style, speed, handling, AWD aspects are great. The fuel economy could be better but is improving as the miles drive increases. Dealer did have to replace the left front brake caliper due to a rattle noise but dealer assured me it was a new, factory replacement part not rebuilt. Would be nice if it had auto on/off headlights and if the air conditioning "auto" function would always work with the recirculating button engaged -- living in the city you have to pretty much keep the recir button on all the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Before purchasing the RDX, I drove a 2005 BMW X3 for three years. I loved my X3, but the newer models are quite expensive. I'm just delighted with the RDX. It has a similar drive to the X3 and the savings over the X3 is huge. Was treated very well by the dealer and I've had for a week and absolutely adore this vehicle. It is designed very well and the interior of the car is actually nicer than the X3, in my opinion. The seating is every bit as good as the X3. I'm looking forward to my first long road trip in my new RDX. It corners like a BMW and has a sports car type feeling when you drive it. It is a nice package!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased this vehicle back in November 07 after trading in my TL, and have been very pleased overall. There is a slight clinking sound from somewhere under the dash that randomly comes and goes and the dealer cannot identify it. Aside from this which does not affect performance, the ride is both quick and sporty. Pick up is incredible with the turbo engine. I find that the cargo space is adequate for our needs and we can fit our child's stroller in the back easily. I can also get golf clubs in back without having to angle them. It is a fast sporty sedan in a mini SUV body. We proceeded to get rid of our Jeep Hemi Engine and lease an MDX as well putting us into our third Acura.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased the RDX with tech package. It is such a fun car to drive. It really has a quick pickup. I'm sometimes surprised how quickly I can take off if I'm not careful. I'm still learning how to work the voice controls and navigation screen. I really did my homework and went back and forth about whether I should lease or own. I've been leasing another make/model SUV for the past 7 years and finally decided the RDX would be worth owning. I comparison shopped the BMW X3 and Mercedes 350. The extras in the Acura for a lot less money were definitely a great incentive. Yet, I feel like the car is just as good if not better. My friends and family love it. I'm having a blast!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2004 Expedition for a more efficient vehicle. After 1400 miles of combined driving the computer indicates we averaged 14.7 MPG on expensive premium gas (required). That is almost exactly the same mileage my big Expedition was obtaining on regular gas. Needless to say, I am terribly disappointed. On a positive note, the car is very comfortable (except, a lot of fun to drive, the technology package is amazing, the sound system is even more amazing. The handling system in the car is a technological masterpiece. But at 28.5 cents per mile for fuel (and rising), it sits peacefully in the garage while we drive our Civic and EOS around town. </TEXT>

Make sure you know what you are getting with the RDX - it is a sports car with stiff suspension and a firm ride so if you want a soft, "never feel a bump" ride then look elsewhere. Went without the tech package - the $4k was too steep for me. If you want the suv where sport meets luxury (and don't need that much cargo room), check it out. </TEXT>

The day after I picked it up I drove 550 miles and averaged 23 MPG. 90% of the time it was downpouring rain in the mountains of WV and VA.

<TEXT>Definitely not worth 33,000 dollars. No leg room for back seats. No auto turn on/off of headlights. Rough riding. Opening the driver door after a drive will not open the back door. You have to use either the remote or the door button to open the back doors. Bad fuel economy. Wish there was atleast a beep sound when you back up to walls or curb (expect that for cars over 30000).

Much more reliable than the BMW and performs better. Gas mileage isn't that bad (about 19) considering it's a 4000 lb car and it flies!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo/performance. Bluetooth/voice commands. Reliability. Great value. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This SUV has it all. All-wheel drive and a turbo and all the technology features you need (including a free 3-months subscription to XM-Radio and a back-up camera) in a true luxury package. This car re-defines obsessive-compulsive traits up towards the maximum in terms of vehicle mechanical design and attention to interior fit and finish. On the road the vehicle is quiet, powerful and handles like a sports car on tight turns. The turbo has no noticeable lag and makes highway merging a breeze. Once at cruising speed, the electronics enable you to easily check on all important vehicle functions without taking you hands off the steering wheel or your eyes off the road. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The paddle shifters add to the feeling of control over the driving experience, especially the ability to down-shift and use engine-braking on steep hills and on slippery surfaces. The heated front seats are great on cold winter days and the dual climate control is perfect. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I finally own my dream vehicle. This RDX is beautiful. I picked the carbon bronze because not too many vehicles on the road are that color. The AWD is superb for handling in any situation. The turbocharged engine is very good for performance in passing and acceleration, better than some V6s. The interior is very comfortable with the adjustable driver seat and roomy enough second row. The satellite radio, 360-watt stereo system, dual climate, digital read-outs, and memory seats are all awesome for standard equipment. The fuel economy is respectable and premium gas is not a problem. This crossover is a 10 all the way around. Thanks Acura for another innovative, top-of-the-line vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up the RDX 2 weeks ago and love it so far. My fiancée wanted an SUV, I wanted a sports car and we settled on the RDX. It has the body and space of an SUV, the interior of a luxury sedan, and drives like a sports car. I spent months looking at similar rides such as the BMW X3, Infiniti EX, Honda CRV, Rav 4 and this car had the most to offer in terms of features and was priced right in the middle of the pack. I couldn't be happier.</TEXT>

Very easy to to use and program. Nav system is also very easy to use, easy to use voice commands. Much better than my Camry bluetooth and nav</TEXT>

<TEXT>When my cute mini cooper became a sled in the Boston winter, I reluctantly hunted for a small SUV. After much deliberation, decided on the Acura over the BMW X3 on cost and reliability. So glad I did - the sound system is superb, the build is quality, bikes fit in the back, the turbo makes pleasing whooshes and the acceleration is plenty for me. Its just as grin inducing as a mini - and no icy skidding. Negatives include instructions more mind boggling than physical chemistry textbooks and a voice recognition system that doesnt quite understand my UK English. However, I'm persevering to learn Honda-ese and confident we'll become friends. An excellent fun car in every way.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great SUV! I received this SUV after totaling my 2002 dodge neon. I was telling my husband how much I loved the MDX but not just any MDX. It had to be the older model because I was no fan of the rounded backs. After a wise car salesman convinced me that I could get a 2008 RDX for the price of a used MDX with nearly 30-50 thousand miles it was no surprised I rushed to take the RDX for a test drive. After the test drive I was sold. We visited that dealership more than my in laws? literally. After a few weeks of debating, on 12/15/07 my husband purchased me the 2008 tech RDX. I have put well over a thousand miles on it and I have had it less than a month. It is a joy to drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the navigation, heated and cooled driver and passenger seats, audio system, the front storage department (3), back up camera, 2 position memory seats, and the height of the driver seat. I feel on top of the world!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've never owned an Acura before but I'm now a huge fan! The RDX is fun to drive, has great visibility, and the base model comes with absolutely everything you'd want (CD, bluetooth, MP3 hookup, XM radio free for 3 months, moonroof, seat warmers, etc). Also, the driver interface (at least on the base model) is intuitive and uncluttered. It feels like they really have the driver in mind. I highly recommend this car! I'm so happy I bought it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I only have a few hundred miles on it. It is well made with nice internals and a few bugs. Complicated not-so-friendly navigation system. One must learn the exact commands (over 100 of them) to handle it safely and efficiently while driving. There is information missing on streets that have been in existence for many (7) years. If that is to be programmed one needs to look up MAP-IT beforehand and find the major intersection.. The engine require synthetic MOBIL-1 oil, and a higher octane gasoline. Trunk is large enough but be prepared to purchase the cargo net. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Still need to work on those but the radio and sun-roof are nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Never did a review before, but had to comment on my new ride. Overall this car is terrific. I find a new feature I love every day. I am on my 5th tank of gas and am getting 21.8 mpg. Traded an '03 Aviator that never got better than 16, so I'm thrilled. Looks good, feels good, drives good. Never owned a 4 cyl. before. Can't believe the pick up. Plenty of power when you need it. Love it! Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed a vehicle to replace my 2002 civic Si. The first time I drove the RDX I knew I wanted one. This thing is as much fun to drive as my Si. If you're looking for a small, quick, great handling SUV with some luxury, this is the vehicle for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Faster and less expensive than the BMW X3, the Acura RDX is about as good as it gets in this segment. It drives like a sports sedan and has plenty of storage. If you're looking at the Murano, you should check out the RDX as well. It's faster and a lot nicer, for only a few thousand dollars more. The SH All Wheel Drive makes accelerating out of a corner nice as well. Overall, I'd give it a 9.5 / 10. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Handling and acceleration are far better than the other SUVs we test drove - Lexus RX 350, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander. Feature for feature, none of the other SUVs we considered could beat the RDX's value. Good thing too, because none of them were nearly as fun. This is an SUV that will provide us plenty of utility, allow us to grow in it, yet small enough for the city, and will continue to be fun so that we won't mind keeping it for a while.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my RDX. I've had this vehicle for almost a month now and I'm very impressed with everything about this SUV. I spent a lot of time researching and comparing different vehicles but once I started test driving them, the Acura RDX with the Tech package really beats all the competition. It's the best luxury for my money. Stereo sound is amazing. Interior and exterior finishing fantastic. Its fun to drive because of the smooth and powerful handling. I'm really happy with my purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since my wife had a baby, I have traded my 06 Acura TL (base) for the 08 RDX base model. Even though I miss my TL, I thought this was a good trade. Pros: This is a fun and powerful vehicle. The turbo gives it an extra kick in acceleration. AWD gives the vehicle more stability. Interior and the exterior design is pretty decent. Stereo sounds is great. Price value is pretty good for a luxury/sport vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After purchasing this car almost two months ago, I decided I had to write a review considering I have found the reviews out on Edmunds to be very helpful. I purchased the RDX after my 2002 VW Jetta broke down which happened frequently. The Acura is a wonderful car in general, and the RDX is great! I couldn't be happier with my decision. It is easy to drive, easy to park, has great acceleration when needed. It is super comfortable and just big enough that I feel like trucks can see me better on the highway. I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for solid reliability and easy maintenance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had this car for about two weeks and love it. Test drove all the CUVs from upscale/luxury to affordable/no frills; from ML350 and X3 to the Ford Edge and Mazda CX7, even drove a Hyundai Santa Fe. None compared to the RDX for the money and the features. It's so much fun to drive and is extremely comfortable. Came from Infiniti M45 so I know comfort and this RDX is just as cushy. Look forward to showing it off to my friends. It was a long process to decide but I'm sure glad I took my time and chose the RDX. It was the best choice for my money! I ordered chrome wheels and now it's looking so pretty!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The body style, navigation system, satellite radio, comfortable seats, roomy interior. The turning radius is incredible! I'm pretty smitten with this car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you get bored easily, opt for the technology package. Not only will this car talk to you but it will let you know exactly whats going on performance-wise down to each wheel. The rumors of turbo lag are true from stand-still acceleration. However, when the turbo kicks in, it's like no feeling a V6 can offer. You feel like you are being lifted off your seat then pushed back into it. My wife has a Murano. This car is much smoother, ride, acceleration, braking and even the seats are softer. If you want the performance that may outrun a BMW 3 series but need room for the family pet, this is the vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the 2008 RDX for just a few days - very impressed so far. Handling and acceleration are great. I'm 6'5" and have over 3 inches of space between my head and the roof - pretty amazing for a car with a moonroof. Initial fit and finish seem perfect. All in all, it's a lot of fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great room in driver's seat. Best stereo I've ever heard in a car. Voice navigation is very cool; not sure yet whether it is a novelty or will be useful longterm. Bluetooth works well with Treo 650. </FAVORITE>
