<TEXT>We bought our Civic at the peak of the gas prices in 2008 in Anchorage. The trip home a week later 350 miles, I got almost 47 MPG. Now with 15K miles, our overall MPG is over 33. That's with studded snow tires half the year which drop it to about 30. 20-50 below temps here are routine, and the Civic has a GREAT heater we really depend on. It is a blast to drive, ours has a 5-speed (hard to find), and it drives best if you short shift to use the ample torque of the smooth as silk engine. It doesn't lug or stumble even at 1000 RPM. Steering is nimble, sporty, and neutral. Only gripes: Poor radio, doesn't handle multiple strong stations well, and wipers-only 1 intermittent setting.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After only 65,000 KM and 1 year, I traded this car in for a Corolla. First vehicle I have owned and not put more than 200,000 KM on. This vehicle, is poorly made. The rattles after only 15K are unacceptable, and everything is breaking. The throw out bearing went out at 40,000 KM along with the 4 disk breaks. The passenger window fell off the track 3 times. The fuel economy of my corolla in the real world is much better, 36 vs 42 MPG mixed driving even thought the civic is rated higher. There is so little low end torque, it is hard to drive efficiently. Also at 110 KM/H the car revs at 3K RPM in 5th. I really expected more! The car is very weak (poor starting/shifting) in cold weather.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car does drive very well. It has quick steering and firm and comfortable seats. The ABS works very well, and the car has lots of Air Bags and seems very safe. Also the car has never left me stranded once it has been started even though it has had many problems.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car in May of 2008, 8 thousand miles later I needed new brakes in the front. Got literally yelled at for driving the car too hard. 8000 miles later, need new brakes again, go into new dealership, they tell me my calipers are defective. 2 months later there is a creaking from my front right, dealer says defective axle. My experience with this car is that it has a lot of defective parts, and Honda just doesn't seem to care anymore. I also drive an 88 prelude si, and the old clutch felt better then the brand new one on the civic. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The only thing good about it is it's sporty appearance, and when it wants to go fast, it does.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car a little over a year ago. Still just as pleased as I was then as I am now. Car drives very well for the function that it serves, can be driven as a fuel efficient commuter or racy sports car. I, on avg, get about 24-27 MIXED mpg and when driving more conservatively I can get this up to 31-32 mpg, believe it or not. As almost everyone else says, this car is fun to drive and master. The engine note at 6000 RPMS is really cool to hear, really feels as if you're driving a more exotic sports car. In this price point some of these features are hard to beat. I drove this car to its limits after the break in period and still enjoy doing so, though not as often, fuel efficiency. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car because of the Civic reliability and mostly because of resale value. I put a lot of miles on my cars and I need a good resale when I go to trade or sell them. I had 2 Hyundai Elantras prior to this car and my Elantra was a lot better car if you ask me. It was much quieter and felt more luxurious, even though it was still sporty and the gas mileage I got was the same. I also had an Accord at one time and it seems Honda cars have a "harder" ride, lots of bumps, lots of noise. Am looking to see what else I can get in 2010 since I'm not too impressed with this car. As someone else said, the struts are noisy, lots of creaks, cabin/wind noise, crappy stereo, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Honda Civic 2008 EX 4 door sedan - Bought on 04/30/2008. Right now has 21800 miles on it. As of today spent $857. Brakes changed on 21000 miles and cost me $507. The tires are fine and I have a plan to drive until 37000 miles at least. No mechanic failure as of today. Drove from DC to NH and GOT 41 MPG. I was surprised really. The real cost of ownership is higher than Edmunds wrote. Let's see: At 18500 miles air filter changed=$230; Plus regular oil&oil filter changes as of today I spent $120; Plus brakes (4 brakes, Plus rotor cleaning) changed at 21000 miles and it cost me $507. Take a look for the numbers if you know how to count and save your money. Honda is practical and economy car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GAS ECONOMY! Comparable lower cost of ownership. Road Handling is fun and cool! Again, QUALITY,QUALITY,QUALITY,QUALITY,QUALITY ,QUALITY!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My mom bought me this car as her final gift to me before she passed from cancer in May 2009. I love this car! I love the dash layout, I'm a big guy though and the seats are a bit narrow. Quick around town, but on a recent trip on route 66 to California I noticed on long inclines you have to put pedal to the floor. Lots of "zip" but horrible acceleration in situations where you pull a U-Turn and have to gun it... almost got hit a couple times because even to the floor it's just so slow getting up to speed. Transmission has inconvenient shift patterns too. That's the only bad, all in all it's great little car and I get over 400MPG on the highway!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design and dash display is a big positive for me, I really like the 2 tier setup. Excellent fuel economy. VERY, VERY solid build compared to Suzuki, Ford, and most others in the same price range. Very solid car with quiet tight interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I downsized from a '06 Audi A4 to a Civic. This car has been nothing but problems. When I bought the car, part of the bumper was scratched and the dealer fixed it. Then my struts were making a creaking noises within weeks of buying the car, the dealer replaced the struts. I complained a couple of times about the air smelling horrible when the A/C was on and they couldn't fix it (they couldn't smell it). The car started to make a ticking noise within the past week and took it into a dealer close to my work. With 31k on the car, the dealer is telling me that I have burned out the clutch and I have to pay $500 for a new clutch! This is a junk car and would not recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car replaced a 2005 STI Impreza; before that I drove a 2001 S2000. The Civic isn't a muscle car like the STI, or a demanding, purpose-built sports car like the S2000, but it is a well executed sports coupe. It is fast when I want it to be, but it's a Civic when that's appropriate. The suspension is well tuned, the front wheel drive works surprisingly well, the brakes are reasonably good, and having the 6000- 8000 vtec power band is fun and effective. The navi system and premium stereo are both treats. All in all, a well executed package. I will keep this one for 5-7 years.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Versatility, handling, interior styling. The engine is a marvel, although it lacks the raw power of the S2000, the ecu tuning has produced a power plant with an amazing functional range--it putts perfectly, and screams when necessary. Well done Honda!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Don't believe those reviews of the car being anything less than great. Honda consistently builds solidly built products. This car really is a joy. I am a college student, so the extra space afforded by the 4 door is helpful, although if anyone is not restricted by space I would recommend the coupe. It is far more attractive and I will most likely go for that when the lease is up. The car is quite low on torque to be honest, but one the cams switch over the car really becomes a beast and the sound is beautiful. If you do not like revving up your engine past 6k then you will never enjoy this car, and you might as well look elsewhere. Great ride, smooth, reliable, decently quick.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Auto trans would downshift out of 3rd and 5th gears under light acceleration. Turns out transmission "adapts" to driver and I had babied it during break in period. Reset computer by holding pos and neg cables together for 2 minutes and then reconnect and let car idle for 10 minutes. Then I drove the car with a heavier foot for about 100 miles and now the shift points are much improved. Am a little wary of maintenance minder. There is no set maintenance schedule and the dealer will nickel and dime you at relatively short intervals. Otherwise, fun to drive and looks great at 30 mpg in mostly city driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>2 tiered dash, better stereo in coupe, telescoping steering, hopeful of Honda reliability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for a few months. It's fun to drive, is cute & has a nice looking interior. I got it mainly as a commute car and it seems to get around 35 mpg, since I do mostly freeway driving. The only thing that I would change would be the seats and the headrests (although I was told the headrests were designed for safety and all cars have them now). My commute takes me a solid hour to get to and from work and the seat can get uncomfortable at times. I find myself trying to adjust into a comfortable position while driving. I didn't have a "seat problem" with my other cars. With the headrest, it feels like it is nudging your head constantly. Other than that, I would recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace my truck due to gas prices. I did not even test drive it, just got into after I signed the paperwork and I don't regret it. I just drove about 10 hours in the car, only had to fill up once from MS to SC about 37 MPG. The only things I found wrong is if you smoke like I do when it is raining the water will come in the front window and there is no ash tray in the car. Also there is not any cup holders in the rear.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive carpool on the highway everyday (a little tight inside, but oh well) and not so much city anymore. I've only gotten below 30 mpg in the city once, and have gotten over 38 on the highway. My usually get around 34-35 combined. I opted not to get a hybrid as it was not going to be as cost efficient for me as the regular Civic. It's not the best accelerator when pulling onto the highway, but then again I traded in my Odyssey (which I loved but could no longer afford to feed) and I smile every time I stop at the gas station. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Downsized from a Prius, payment too high. Leasing Civic for $199.00 per/mth. Civic an adequate replacement. Not the same mileage, but close. Civics? sticker about $8,000 less than the Prius. Prius mpg 47-51 mpg. Civic is 29-41. Civics? positives: great fuel economy 31-32 suburban, 38-41 on highway. Nice styling outside. Civic negatives: Roofline too low, hard to get in & out of and I'm short. The seats are as hard as a park bench, most uncomfortable seats of any car I ever owned. Civic AC in Arizona summers sucks. AC cuts out by design during acceleration to save gas. Ride is too firm for my tastes. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I came to the Civic from a '99 Caddy STS. While it isn't as comfortable as the Caddy and lacks the 300hp engine, It still boasts some very impressive features. For instance, I typically get about 30-35 mpg city and about 40-45 mpg highway. The car is very fun to drive (I love the manual transmission). The ride is pretty smooth. I'm a pretty big guy (6'1, 280 lbs) and I fit just fine. There's plenty of legroom (I don't even put the seat all the way back!). However, I wouldn't recommend the coupe to anyone planning to move 4 adults. The back seat is way to small for most adults. My 17 lb dog seems pretty comfortable back there, but I can't imagine any more substantial creature would be.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There's plenty of extra room in the spare tire compartment for jumper cables, etc. Meaning the large trunk is free for whatever I want to put in there! It performs well enough and gets great gas mileage. It's comfortable, even for a larger person.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2008 Civic lx with 3500 miles is getting 25 mpg. My 2004 Odyssey gets 20 and 22 mpg. I do not like the 5 spd auto. It gets on my nerves shifting up and down. It replaced a 1994 escort that never got less than 29 mpg the entire time we had it. And the shifter doesn't stop till d3. I do love everything else about this car but I will never buy another Honda. We will trade this car as soon as we can afford to unless the mpg goes up to 30. Oh yeah, the paint will fade from the acid rain and for an extra $500 they will cover it for 5 years. I have been very happy with my salesman and service rep since 2004. But if I want new untested improvements that may or may not work I will get a Honda! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my civic for ~5 months now, and put over 9,000 miles on it. It's been fantastic, and I've only had to get an oil change once (because of the new more aerodynamic design, according to my dealership). It's a solid car, that I am very happy with. I did a lot of background research before I made the purchase, and it definitely stood far out beyond the other cars of its class. It's got a slightly sporty interior, that honestly feels luxurious. My only real complaint is that I've been getting approx. 30 mpg highway. I was expecting much higher, but considering I don't exactly drive in a way conducive to ideal gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The audio input jack, and the digital speedometer. When I first got the car it took a few days to get used to, but I love it now. I also like the 40/60 backseats. I've fit a whole queen-size bed frame in my civic (broken down of course).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I initially bought the hybrid to drive in the HOV lane to save time going to work. I got it just prior to gas prices going up so I paid invoice. This car has really impressed us on its ride and especially the mileage. I have gotten just over 40 mpg average since purchasing the vehicle 13,000 miles ago. I tried to be a miser on one tank and got 52 mpg. Handling is smooth and tight compared to the top heavy Prius. Great car, would buy another. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Honda Civic on April 2008. Since that time I am trying to calculate the miles on the each tank. But I never got more than 23 miles average MPG with the mixed driving in city and highway. I cannot believe that someone gets more than 28 miles MPG. The interior is fine except the place for speedometer. The starting of movement is fine. I can get 40-45 miles per hour when RPM under 1700. The exterior is really nice. The car is wonderful for a small family. I could get 32 miles MPG just on highway, but I never got 38 miles MPG on highway, it is unrealistic. Even I have a hard foot, I think that I could get more MPG than I have now. I made 7600 miles and generally OK with the Civic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2008 civic has a bad hesitation on take off, not sure why but I noticed many people with same issue, otherwise it has pep. The interior on my LX lacks cup holders in the back, the truck does not open from the remote, the roof when washing it buckles, very thin. It has plenty of air bags but probably for good reason. I like the low tire pressure warning. I think for the $ it's not a bad car, I use it to drive to work. Gas mileage has been averaging about 31 mpg for me, I am a little heavy on the gas pedal. This is my first Honda, not sure if I would get another one, probably worth shopping around. I was going to get a Mini Cooper, but my wife and kids talked me out of it, maybe next time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First sedan in 10 years and we really like it. Looks great, sporty and well designed. Mostly city driving and getting on average 28 MPG. For those who say it's short on room, I have no idea what car they're in but we have a family of 3 and were used to SUVs and this really works well. More than enough leg and head room plus the trunk holds all the baseball stuff plus chairs with room for more. Never have purchased an extended warranty but I did on this one and saved 1/2 over the dealer cost by googling online and found a dealership in Rhode Island that sells them dirt cheap and they are the exact same ones the local Honda dealer sells.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So this is my third civic. 1st one i totaled 2nd one was a 2004 civic sedan and now the 08 EX-L coupe. Love the leather. Love the handling. I have a lead foot and this car just flows with me around the turns. For example, there's a turn that's legally supposed to be taken 35 but this car goes 60 on it easily without even a skid of the tires. Hugs the road perfectly, great suspension. Fun to drive. If your like me and love just letting it all loose on the road and having a great time. this civic is for you. The leather trim steering wheel.seats, seat warmers and great interior doesn't hurt either.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A Honda is a Honda so you can expect to get efficiency and economy. The design inside and out is the best that I can find in this price range. Well laid out interior controls are user friendly. The split dash is a plus in my opinion. I can see the speedometer without taking my eyes off of the road. I compared the Civic to the Corolla, Mazda 3 and Toyota Matrix. The Mazda and Matrix just didn't have the fuel economy that I was looking for. Anything that averages 30+ mpg is what I needed. The Corolla passes the fuel economy test but many editor reviews seem to be disappointed with the Corolla's performance overall. I'm not impressed with the exterior styling of the Corolla either.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car to replace my '03 Accord that was totaled in an accident. Was considering a new Accord, but the price of Accords have gone up from when I purchased my '03. And I was looking for a car with better gas mileage than the current Accord. I decided to give the Civic a chance. I'm glad I did! I loved this car from my first test drive. It is surprisingly roomy and has a peppy engine---acceleration is more than adequate. I have only owned this car for 1 month. 3 tanks of gas with gas mileage slowly improving from 28 to 29, to 30. This is with my A/C on ALL the time (in 100+ degrees) and with mixed highway/city driving. I am sure gas mileage will improve.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Paint is a lot better quality than on my '03 Accord, digital odometer, expected re-sale value, (hopefully) Honda reliability like my 2 previous Hondas, gas mileage. The Civic is also more fun to drive than my old Accord, maybe because of its smaller size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looking for great MPG and comfort on long trips in car I plan to own over 10 years and 200,000 miles. Have owned the car for 2 months and have over 5,000 miles. MPG has ranged from 42 to 47 using 89 octane 90% Ethanol fuel in Midwest. 1/2 has been Interstate mileage at 75-80 mph with A/C. Best mileage was 47 mpg with 65 mph highway night time with no A/C. Car has been everything I hoped for! My concerns include (1) Auto stop engine cutoff at stop light/signs on hill and car will roll back if break not fully depressed. (2) Accelerating power at either a stopped position moving into traffic or passing at high speed is limited. Only 2nd new car bought. Prius wait 9 months; Civic 2 weeks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First Honda I have owned but my 2 sons have both driven hondas. They were right about the seats, they are some of the most comfortable I have ever had in a vehicle. Almost 3000 miles so far and have averaged 30+mpg every tank. It's real hard to keep the revs under 6000. When you reach that point its almost like a turbo kicking in. Sticks to the road and takes the curves like a race car. Love to push this thing around the twists. Firm ride but not choppy, great sound system, it really rocks. I had the aero kit installed and it looks great super sporty in ralleye red. Nothing but compliments on the looks. Overall a great combination of performance and economy. </TEXT>

I came from a Nissan altima 3.5SL which was sneaky fast in a straight line but handled horribly. This car handles awesomely with only slightly less performance. This is without the summer tires. I live near St. Louis and we usually see at least some snow so opted for the all seasons. Best of all I can drive the heck out of it and get 28 mpg (yes I use the vtec). That is the lowest I have gotten since owned usually getting 29 mpg. Granted it is premium fuel, but I usually got 25 mpg with less aggressive driving in the altima. Excellent fit and finish.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Good news and Bad news: The Good news is that the Honda Civic Coupe looks hot, reaches 36 mpg on the highway, it was pretty fun to drive, and costs under $15,000. Bad news: The car LOOKS hot, but it really isn't, the headroom makes people annoyed, and it isn't a luxury car (at all). The Civic coupe is best for teenagers who want 0 to 60 times of under 8 seconds, but who don't want to break their budget. It's a nice compact car that isn't so show-offy. It gets good gas mileage. It was pretty fun to drive. If it was given a grade in school, it would be given an 85%. It's a solid car, just nothing special.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the Civic after several co- workers talked about how much they loved theirs. I went from a crown vic w/p71 package to this and love it. Much better on gas first tank had 39 mpg now after 3 tanks avg 35 mpg all highway @80 mph. It's comfortable considering I am a big guy (6,2) and not exactly small. LOL. The interior is great love the leather seats I bypassed the ex-l w/navi for reg ex-l and not sorry. The ride is fine but loud on certain types of pavement (hwy) anyway. Would highly recommend one. Going one way to work @57 miles its comfortable and dear I say sporty. Head room is great even with the sunroof.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always driven American made cars. I would never give in to the Honda hype. So many people had them. When gas prices went up these recent months I decided it was time to trade my SUV to save gas money. It took me a few weeks to get used to the small size, but now I'm hooked. The first two tanks of gas alone sold me. I am surprised how well my civic handles. I have driven it in pouring rain and not been afraid, the steering is very good. I was shocked how quickly I have gotten used to the smaller size. The only true complaint is that since I am a tall girl (5'8") it is kind of hard to get in and out of. Once I am in though, I'm very comfortable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The gas mileage is great! I love that I didn't have to give up my leather (with heated seats), since the 2008 now has a leather package. I love the blue backlit instrument panel, radio display, and the placement of the digital speedometer. I also like the warning light for the tire pressure.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was transferred to a new plant which increased my drive to around 35 miles one way. I justified buying the Civic based on the 36 mpg. I have documented 8 straight tank fulls, after reaching 3000 miles, that never got over 30. This is driving 30+ interstate miles one way with the cruise set at 70mph. I carried it to the dealer and got nowhere. Wrote Honda a letter and was basically told "your problem." I have 3 Honda's in my driveway now but will not have another! If you are thinking of buying a Civic I strongly suggest you really investigate all other options first.</TEXT>

Looks good in most places but feels cheap in some. ex. inside door lever, hand break,etc *Don't like fabric on the door handles and console. Waiting to get dirty and stained. * body materials 'very' thin and some plastic. Lightly press or rub roof and it flexes. Doors sound cheap and hollow when closed. * Road noise if that is of concern to you. * cannot use DVD media in stereo to play mp3 and dvds.

<TEXT>I got a Honda Civic as my second car, got my first when I was 16 and it was a Sunfire with AMAZING gas mileage but it was old and needed a new car. I liked the Civic for all its features but mostly the gas mileage but after 800 miles and 3 tanks later I am only getting 24.5 miles per gallon and don't understand why. I wanted 29 at least like it said! So I'm not happy but wondering if maybe there is a reason and if someone can tell me why I would very much appreciate it!

<TEXT>Purchased first Honda car after years of owning Corollas. Was looking for a four door with more power, and great gas mileage. Purchased the car due to its many performance, safety features and its low price. I am satisfied with the vehicles performance, and have been getting 30 mpg. I could use more room in the front seat, but I am 6'3'' 250 lbs. Car has many blind spots. Overall, it seems to be a solid car, nice combination of ride/ handling. Easily accelerates to highway speeds. Peace of mind with the standard side curtain air bags. The interior dash is different but a nice change. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Finally sold off the 93 DX MT model for a 2008 EX AT and couldn't be more satisfied. The EX gets 32 City with AC. Highway mileage is also impressive - we're getting 38 on the highway! Can't ask for a smoother, more quiet ride. Enjoying the keyless entry, remote trunk, 6 speakers, and there's plenty of room for the 6'2" passengers. It's a great value for the money. The dealer installed the low profile spoiler and tinted the windows. Now we really look cool! We researched and test drove a couple SUVs as well as the Corolla and Accord. They couldn't compare to the Civic's ride and reputation for dependability. </TEXT>

On takeoff, hot air blows through vents because sensor apparently shuts A/C off during hard acceleration. The A/C and cooling fans in this car are unsatisfactory. Dealer said they've had alot of complaints about it. Can't believe Honda let this one out the door. I'll pass on the Civic and Accord. Accord didn't handle/ride very well.

We have taken several 400 mile trips and find the Civic to be stable and effortless on the highway. We have discovered that keeping cruise speed below 68 mph increases gas mileage by nearly 6%.

<TEXT>Bought in Nov 07 with Nav and XM. More comfortable than the BMW 335 I looked at. More comfortable seats; more headroom. On the Highway at 65 mph I get 46-50 mpg, depending on hills or flat road. In town with stop and go I get around 30 mpg in the winter and 36 in the summer for short trips. Hybrid engines need to be warmed up for good mpg. (My wife's 2006 Odyssey gets 14-15 mpg in town and 24-25 on the highway.) The mpg calculated by the number of gallons of gas I use and miles I drive is 1-2 mpg higher than that shown on the dashboard mpg computer. MPG depends on weather, avg speed, hills, frequency of stops and starts, how soon you get off the gas before you stop, and how you accelerate.</TEXT>

In addition the seats are comfortable in the back and in the front, even for me (I'm 5'11"). I love the styling, and the air conditioning is good. I even got cold in like 91 degree weather.

<TEXT>Before buying my civic (Jun 6,08) I drove the Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla. The Corolla was a good and I would have bought one but having two other Hondas (97 Odyssey & 97 Civic, both still going strong) it was hard to leave a good thing. My compromise was I couldn't get stability control but buying it with the Corolla would have meant having other options I didn't want. I went with the LX over the EX because I didn't want the sunroof or 5-spoke alloy wheels (just didn't like the look). However, Honda has a 15', 7-spoke wheel that is nice. I bought them and a trunk liner from College Hills Honda (on-line) for about one-half the cost my local dealer wanted. </TEXT>

My friend hates to ride with me because I drive so slowly. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. The only time the gauge has me getting good gas mileage is when my foot is off the gas pedal.

Would definitely buy again if given the chance. People looking for a great car at a great price, look no further. I get comments all the time from people that like the shape and interior design. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very reliable vehicle, gets highway mileage in the mid 50 mpg range. It is a very well-appointed ride and comfortable enough for my 57 year old bones. Yes it is fun to drive and stylish, the design is great. It is my second Civic and my fifth Honda. Needless to say that the Honda people have great products and quality. Love the auto-stop on the engine when stopping, saves gas, only a little getting use to at first. The A/C is great and it continues to work fine when auto-stop is engaged. Now that feature is a plus in these 90+ degree days. Would I buy another Civic Hybrid? Definitely yes. Hydrogen fuel cells are on the horizon, Honda will be there with as good as it gets then too</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto stop with gas engine off and electric running A/C and rest of the car. The finish is great, the quality is top notch. Visibility is excellent and the ride is great. The 50+ mpg is definitely a hit with these over inflated gas pump prices. Feels little better when you can go 600+ miles on a tank</FAVORITE>

With my commute of 80 miles round trip five days a week, I'd be saving over $4000 over five years (in today's $4.50 per gallon gas price) compared to the 2007 Accord V6 it replaced that gets 27 mpg in conservative driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife has a Prius and I have the Civic. The Civic's gas engine runs more than the Prius' so it's not as fuel efficient but still VERY good at 44 mpg 90% city driving. The Prius shuts off its gas engine whenever it has an opportunity but the Civic does it only when the car is stopped at "D" or at VERY light throttle. If the car is in "Park", the gas engine will keep running, unlike the Prius. It's much more fun-to-drive than the Prius thanks to its sportier ride and handling. It doesn't have as many gadgets to play with but it has all the essentials. If your only concern is fuel economy, buy a Prius. If you want more fun while saving gas, get a Civic Hybrid.. shorter wait, too! 6wks vs 8+ wks</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Civic Hybrid about two months ago and have put over 5000 miles on it already. I live out in the country and do a lot of highway miles but also work in the city. For my last 150 miles (which was almost all highway) I got ~57 mpg. Over all for the ~5200 miles I've driven, I'm getting 48 mpg! I've had no issues at all and the Civic has enough pep for getting on the highway, or climbing hills. The mileage started (during the first few weeks) around 43-44 mpg, but has continued to improve. As a driver with a hybrid, you can become more concerned with mpg than mph. I've learned to drive slower to enhance my gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG. I like the large digital speedometer and active mpg gauge. All cars should give this kind of good feedback in real time on your mileage.

There are blemishes and white spots along with over-spray on the bottom of the rear bumper panel. I have 3200 miles on the car and so far I have no complaints as far as any performance issues. I suggest when you buy any car to go over it with a very good eye. The dealership promises you the world before you purchase it as any car salesman would do to get your money.

<TEXT>I've been driving Ford SUVs for over 20 years and with the crazy fuel prices I decided to go back to driving a car. After getting in the driver's seat, I wish I had made my decision to buy sooner! Once seated, you feel like you're in a sports car, the seat fits just right and the tilt/telescopic steering wheel adjusts perfectly! On the road the Civic is responsive and is very nimble in its handling. Having the audio and cruise controls on the wheel is great, everything is at hand and in sight. Speaking of sight, the instrument panel is in plain view, nothing is obstructed. My combined MPG is 34 and climbing. IMO Honda has done an outstanding job w/ quality and ergonomics.

Are we happy? Yes! I like the gas mileage but it isn't a Camry in comfort and ride, but didn't expect it to be. The bad: we noticed a small ding on the truck lid, however very faint and we asked for a hundred off and got it so I shouldn't complain since I made the deal. I did noticed that the trunk lid isn't exactly centered. The door jams were dirty, and grease on the carpet mat that I ask the dealer to clean and they did. Other than than so far so good.</TEXT>

Took the car in found that the suspension needed to be fixed, the front tires had to be replaced and the cd player among other items. A month into ownership, the car starts making all kinds of rattles, and loud noises when coming to a stop. Cat was replaced and many clips and molding in the car.

<TEXT>We sold out Mitsubishi Evolution in an effort to decrease our car payment and decrease our gas consumption. The civic seemed like the obvious winner in our minds. We wanted a bigger vehicle (Accord or Acura TL) but their real world gas mileage isn't that great. We settled with the smaller civic and are very happy. The leather is great and I'm sure the heated seats will be nice this winter. We started around 32-33 MPG and the last 2 tanks have been 35+. We drive 85% highway @ 80 MPH. The engine power isn't bad considering we live +7k feet elevation. It should be more than adequate everywhere else in the country. Maybe not as quick as the competitors (mazda3) but a great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned this car for 7 months now. This car pretty much seemed problem free up until when the weather gets really hot. Squeaks and rattles appear to come alive throughout the interior and pinpointing the area is difficult. Both sun visors came apart in the heat and failed to stay up. A/C condensation spills into the passenger interior instead of outside. Interior is very easy to scrape/scratch/scuff. Interior fabric and door panels will start to fade in the Summer sun. As for the driving aspect, clutch squeak, gear shifting hits a wall (all gears) and a/c belt squeak is becoming a common recurrence. Pedestrians will get lost in the large blind spots and the throttle response lags.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a vehicle that would help my pocketbook and not cost an arm and a leg. I looked at the Prius, but I found that most dealerships did not have them in stock and no one had the base model. This meant that I would be paying 27K at standard back rate of 6%,with tax and no money down this put me at $562.43 per month. I bought my Honda at a dealership in Las Vegas. They charged me and not a penny above that $22,600 plus fees came out to $24,715 at 2.9% from Honda this put me at $443. per month. The Honda has a 45 MPG rating like the Toyota, and looks like a real car. The only thing I don't like about this car is a smallish trunck. I can live with that for $100 less</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Civic. I had a couple years ago and have been with GM for many years. After constant problems with GM and fuel prices, have gone back to Honda. I'm 6'3" 210 lbs, and I had to have the driver's seat customized and moved back 3" to accommodate my legs. Now that I've done that it's totally comfortable. I didn't realize it was just a bit to short in legroom until a long drive, my Hondas years ago had more leg room. Other than that, a real great car. Totally worth the $ for the Si. I think the other models I would be disappointed in lack of power coming from a 3.8 V6 Grand Prix GT but this Si is even faster and performs better than the Grand Prix. Gas mileage awesome!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this a few weeks back and so far so great! The fuel economy is great, the ride is tight and at 6'3" plenty of room for a small car. The engine is small but peppy. The feel is tight and responsive although not overly smooth. Only complaint is the sound system which, as written about previously, is lacking. I upgraded the speakers to some Pioneer three ways which broadened the spectrum quite a bit. A larger amp and sub woofer would help but is not a pressing need. Overall this is a great car for my commute and around town needs. Highly recommended.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Honda, and my first Civic. My last two were accords, both bought new. I just sold my '91, with 326k on the odometer, for $1,800! Looked and ran almost as good as new. You take good care of a Honda and it'll return the favor. This Civic is an awesome little car, roomy, zippy, comfortable. The gas mileage is fantastic. I have a heavy foot and it's hot where I live in the summer. I usually set the cruise control at 75, drive 50 miles a day, 5 days a week, with the A/C on, and I've been averaging 34 mpg! The build quality is typical Honda, tight panel gaps, no creaks or rattles. Overall, I have zero complaints. Honda has done it again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I loved the Mugen from the first time I saw it on the showroom floor -- I knew I had to have it. Sure, it's way more than the base Si, but a test drive of the two will let anyone know that the money was well spent on the suspension and wheels/tires. The looks I could care less about, but the handling is absolutely superb! Ride is harsh, as you would expect from a sports car, but the gas mileage is amazingly good (about 26 mpg in 100% city for me, even with "spirited driving"). The only cons for me are the lack of nav and the fact that it's a car that must be parked "out of the way" so as to avoid vandalism/theft. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car. I bought it for the reputation, safety rating and gas mileage. Pros: drove from Los Angeles to Dallas and got 36 hwy and up to 46 when not using the A/C, very ?zippy? and fun to drive. Huge windshield allowing passenger to prop feet up on dash, adequate room inside and trunk. Cons: sometimes acts like it wants to stall when idling. Front brakes replaced at 22,000 miles (not covered by warranty). I was told this was due to driving in LA traffic which I believe; CD player died so entire audio system replaced 8 months after purchase (covered by warranty) and lots of road noise.

<TEXT>I just got a major service (tune up). I was told I need brakes again. In less than 2 years this will be my 4th set of brakes. They say it must be that I drive in the city. Well I have been driving in the city 37 years and never had this many brake jobs in so little time.The car sits low to the ground and scrapes the front bumper when parking head in. The inside frame between the windshield and window is so thick and slanted that you can miss pedestrians in a crosswalk. Even the smallest bump makes a big bang and it is very noisy in the cabin when on the freeway. the paint scratches and chips too easy. Gas mileage is not spectacular. I'm sure there is more.

<TEXT>The Bridgestone tires wore out at 18000 miles. The dealer said that they were out of round. They also got very noisy before they were replaced. This appears to be a HUGE problem for Honda. Their solution is keep putting tires on every 18000 miles and put up with the howling tires until they are replaced. I have talked to 2 of our friends that have the same problem. I asked the service manager if they have fixed this problem since it has been a problem since 2006 and he said "They think they have". I disagree, I KNOW THEY HAVE NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I wrote several reviews and will try to keep updating how is my Honda doing. Ok As of today, no mechanical failure. Have a plan to change the brakes at 20K miles. MPG improved from 22 to 24.5 mpg in just in city driving. Tires are fine and have a plan to drive 20K miles with the same tires as I purchased with at 10 miles. Some people complained about tires, I would say that the tires are fine. Also, the brakes will go out on the basis of your driving style. If you are aggressive driver and like to brake so often, I think no one brake will stay alive for a long time. As of today I spent $350. $120 cost me for 3 oil/oil filter change. Plus I spent $230 for air filter change on 18500 miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was a great purchase. It gets 35 mpg in the winter and 40+ in the summer. There is plenty of room inside and it is a ball to drive. Lots of pickup for passing and it corners like a go-kart. Oddly enough, many people don't recognize it as a Honda, they think it's a little exotic of some sort. I'm glad I bought before $4.00 comes back to stay...just fill it up and drive all week.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body style, ride, economy, interior layout/color, quality, but mostly the freedom I get from the 40 mpg. The car also tells you when it needs service saving the owner dollars.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just went one year in my Hybrid - 18,006 miles. My low mpg has been 41 and highest was an interstate drive from Richmond to Miami at 56.4 mpg for the trip. Terms like performance and fun differ with this car. I have owned Audis before this and still keep a Miata in the garage. They are the traditional performance models. The Hybrid ranks high in performance for how it performs its mission - transporting me around in relative comfort with extremely good mileage. The car is slow to accelerate but if you adjust your driving habits (I have) the reward is peak mpg. I still get to my destination but I do not have to pass other cars or arrive first. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. mpg 2. split dash keeps digital dials in line of sight 3. auto a/c 4. reliability - not a single service issue except oil change/tire rotation. 5. did I say mpg? I LOVE going 550 miles on a tank! 6. CVT is sooooo smooth</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have been having battery problems. During the winter had problems driving car. Dealership said not using the car a lot and going on short trips would probably do it. At stop lights the car cuts out - I thought it was just me but anyone who has driven the car said the same thing. Drove to New Glasgow 200 km trip - When heading back car wouldn't start - had to call roadside assistance - which I must say are excellent. I have Sirius Satellite in my car - they said that it is a serious drainage on my battery using it. I contacted Sirius on this and they have never heard of this being a problem. My boss has his plugged in all the time and never had a problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Fantastic car for the money. It's hard to have more fun for 20k. When driving hard, it just begs you to drive harder and punish it more! DON'T SHIFT!! Keep those RPM's climbin!!! Torque only kicks in after 5000 rpms which is its major and pretty much only flaw. 6spd manual is smooth with short throws and ability to slam gears with ease. Handling is a little snug but I experience a small amount of understeer at higher speeds. Steering firm and precise. Sound system caught me by surprise (standard sub-woofer) is actually good and ipod hook-up makes me forget about the 50lb cd case to lug around. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine noise, the transformations from nice low hum to growling beast @ 6-7000 RPM's is exhilarating. Ability to drive as hard as I can without worry.... Seats are snug and comfortable for medium commutes. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought 2 2008 Civic Hybrids being told that we would get 40/45 mpg and I have 4000 on one of the and 700 on the other. We get 28/30 mpg at the best and they tell us that nothing is wrong with them. Anyone else have this problem? Service even told us that they get a lot of complaints about this and that most people don't buy them for the mileage. I find this hard to believe.

It is hard to believe the workmanship and performance of this generation civic for the price. I drive an average of 250 miles a day and get 40 mpg highway at 65mph. This is the same mpg as my 98 civic dx but with 35 extra hp. My LX handling is better than ever, even compared to older Si models.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was initially skeptical of the hybrid vehicles because I thought I would have to sacrifice so much for the sake of better fuel mileage. I couldn't have been more wrong. Now that the car has "broken in," I not only enjoy my daily drive, but I enjoy a minimum 44 MPG (even at $4/gallon fill-ups are less that $40) with top fuel mileage topping out at over 49 MPG. As far as performance, the car handles great and I don't feel like I've sacrificed anything on the road - acceleration is better than adequate and the car rolls nicely at 80-85mph. Part of me wants to be selfish and steer people away because increased supply will only drive up prices, but ultimately we'll all be better off. Get one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a little car that gets about 28 MPG combined driving and around 33 MPG on highway. This is very close to what our 2004 Accord does, and the Accord is 4 years old. I was expecting MORE. It is well constructed and easy to drive. The driver seat is a little hard. I do not like the gas gauge; would prefer one that shows 1/4 1/2, 3/4 and full. Those little dots on the gas gauge leaves much to be desired. The AC is not adequate at low speeds and the split level puts too much on the feet and not enough on the upper level. I may not keep this car very long.</TEXT>

Checked my mileage this evening for the first time and found it to be slightly above 30 mpg. I had to learn to not overdrive the steering wheel, because this thing changes direction quickly.

<TEXT>Just bought the civic and love it. We chose the civic over the Sentra due to the amount of head room with a sunroof while sitting in the back seat. With two men 6'3" this has to be considered. The Civic is so sleek and looks like a European car. The handling is smooth and full of energy. The back seat has plenty of leg room. It is hard finding a small car to accommodate tall people comfortably. The car handles smoothly and quickly. I know this car will still be parked in our driveway 10 years from now, Lord Willing. The car we just replaced was a 12 yr old Accord due to an accident. We are thrilled with the interior design. Would have liked a locking glove compartment. </TEXT>

Hondas and Toyota / Lexus are always my favorites (for the obvious reasons), and Honda has really upped their game even more with their new lineup. For the price (especially w / the great lease offers they have), the new Civic is a really smart option. Probably one of the best cars in this price range as far as curb appeal, build quality, gas mileage, and general "fun to drive" factors go. Definitely recommend it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>1st time I drove this car, I was impressed but not sold. After I test drove the Mazda3(base model, manual trans.) 3 days later, I was leaning towards it. I collected my tribe later that day and since we'd be driving past the Honda dealer on the way, I decided to give the Civic another look. Boy I'm glad I did! We were all fairly impressed with the Civic, particularly the backseat leg room. After the 2nd test drive of the Mazda3 (auto trans this time) we made a unanimous family decision. The styling, particularly the ugly taillight design, tight legroom and general ho-hum design, led us back to the Civic. I couldn't be happier after buying a Civic. Great value, in my opinion the best in class!</TEXT>

That's 600.7 miles when I filled up I could only fit 10.26 gallons in the tank. I have twice averaged 56 MPG and easily can do 50-53 MPG. It is all in how you drive these cars, I spend a lot of time keeping momentum and if you are at speeds less than 45 mph you can very lightly press the throttle pedal and run only on the electric motor. I love this car! Great fuel mileage and Honda build quality.</TEXT>

Bought this Honda so I wouldn't have to take out a second mortgage on my house. The Honda states it gets 27 city and 35 mpg highway. This is bull, I just finished my first tank of gas, I just filled up the car, mind you I have been driving the car like an old man. Mostly city and very little highway I just calculated out at 20.58 mpg. I knew the ratings were bogus, every car I have owned the stated mpg is always about 7 to 10 mpg off. As far as you people here stating that you got 32 mpg 35 mpg 38 mpg is that downhill without a driver? You cannot drive this car any slower than me</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted an '08 Accord but in light of current fuel prices, decided on the Civic. I wanted the EX, but after driving the EX and LX, decided there wasn't enough difference between 'em to justify the price variance. This is my 3rd Honda and I am very pleased with the quality that goes into them. My '91 Accord had 326k original miles on the clock when I sold it to a co- worker for $1,800!! Looked great, ran like new. I will agree with prior comments re: the road noise, it is a bit much on rough pavement. On freshly paved roads, though, it's quiet as a tomb. This has a lot to do with the Goodyear Eagle RSA tires. When they wear out, I'll install comparable Michelins, which are quieter.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior & exterior appearance, fit & finish, comfort, the close tolerances of the body panels, the way the doors close with a solid, substantial 'thunk' that sounds a lot like a BMW, G35, Lexus or MBZ.

<TEXT>I've had this car now for 1 month and 1300 miles, and I'm loving it. You won't find a better combination of acceleration, handling, looks, reliability, and practicality at the 20k price point. I always look forward to driving it. For a 2.0 L 4cyl with only a rated 139 lb-ft of torque, the pull even from low rpm in any of the first 4 gears is surprisingly strong. Wind it out to 7-8k rpm and you feel like your driving a F1 race car! This car is every bit as quick and much more nimble than the V6 '02 Maxima it replaced. I've experienced 28-29 mpg thus far, which I feel is plenty decent given the performance this car delivers. I'd recommend it to anyone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased on 12/31/07 in time to still get the $2,300 tax credit. I drive a lot of miles (25,000 a year), so gas mileage was my #1 concern. I have 11,579 miles on the car now and it has been fabulous. My gas mileage was in the 40-43 range for the first two to three months due in large part to breaking in the car as well as the Illinois winter I was driving in. Since then my gas mileage has gotten better and better as the weather warmed up and the car began to get broken in. My last 7 tanks of gas have gotten me 51, 50, 51, 50, 53, 52 and 51 MPG! I drive on the interstates with the cruise set at 65 mph and I neither accelerate nor brake hard in the city in an effort to maximize my MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For all you folks who are searching for the 'Ideal' all around vehicle, this is it. This is my second review of this 2008 Civic LX and after 3000 miles since my last I can report that this is the best choice for a compact car I've ever made. Quiet, comfortable and economical. Most of my driving is on the interstate with consistent speed (68mph). I have seen an average of 41+ mpg on my 168 mile round trip per day. Comfort is excellent for a vehicle of this size. Noise levels are low and you can't even hear the engine at high speed. It also runs considerable slower than my previous 2001 Civic EX (2200 rpm at 70 mph). Workmanship is superb. I have to fight my wife to drive this Civic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have thoroughly enjoyed my purchase of this Civic. I use it for mostly city driving, and still get better than 31 mpg a tank, highlighted by a 38.4 tank on the highway. So far, very reliable, no surprises. It is able to accomplish all tasks I ask of it, including transporting bikes with a trunk rack. It has a very receptive pick up when necessary, but no sports sedan by any means. I like the interior styling overall, like all the storage compartments. Radio is decent, wouldn't mind a 6 cd changer instead of the single slot. For exterior styling, I'm a big fan but I think the wing spoiler is a must, keeps it from looking like grandma's car.</TEXT>

I've owned the car for about two weeks now, but put 2,000 miles on it already. My wife and I took it two days after buying it on our vacation from Ohio to North and South Carolina. The performance and specifically the handling on this car are outstanding. Snicky 6-speed manual, point and shoot steering, and good throttle response make the Si a wonderful road car.

<TEXT>I have been a sports car guy - until $4.00 gas. I traded my 04 Accord V6 M6 on a new Hybrid. You have to learn a new driving skill - slow and steady vs. pushing apex turns. Have been rewarded with combined mileage 43.8 and Highway is 55.6. There is a lot of no a/c use to get this. Wind drag at speed over 50 mph kills mileage. I'm staying at 58 mph on I-95 (dangerous but economical). You need to squeeze the pedal gently and learn to coast a lot. I have enjoyed the smooth driving style that results in top mpg. No rushing, no frantic lane changing - slow and steady wins the race. In this era of energy crisis I felt led to do something to do my part - Civic Hybrid is my statement.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior feels very open with expansive views - I like the two- tiered dash (reminds me of my departed RX-8, but not its 16 mpg).

The 4door sedan has enough room for my family of 4 with 2 car seats in back. I have been getting on average about 27 MPG and that is with some hard driving every now and then. The beauty about the car is that you can have a fuel economy car and then rev the engine a little higher and get a quick ride. The engine sounds great when your get above 5000 rpm. The 2 tier dash takes a little getting used to but definitely stands out from the crowd. The premium stereo sounds pretty darn good and the interior has a nice fit and finish.

Trunk space is considerable given the size of the car. I traded a Chevrolet Silverado to this car, so the change was considerable, but at this time I'm thinking I may not want to own anything else.

I drive approximately 60 miles per day and this is just exactly the car I need. I have gotten 45.25 mpg and normally around 42 mpg with every tank. The extremely hot weather has drug it down a couple of mpg, but who can even complain with 40 mpg?!? (The onboard MPG gauge is always a couple of mpg less than if calculated manually.)

Overall MPG average has steadily increased to 45 MPG over 8000 miles as I have learned and adjusted driving habits. Last several tanks between 48 to 50. High tank was 56 MPG!

<TEXT>The car is well built and fit and finish is very good. The figure I provided for miles driven is from past experience. This Honda has 800 miles on the odometer. I am not pleased with the gas mileage. I did not check the first fill up, but I got 31 MPG on the second and 26 MPG on the third. The little booklet that is provided for fast reference indicates I can check average fuel mileage, but this feature is not available on my car. I am a retiree who drives very reasonably.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a recently purchased Civic Si Sedan and hav a little over five hundred miles on it. Overall it's a great little car that's practical. It seats my wife and I plus our two small kids well, with room to spare in tthe trunk. I handles great especially with the summer tires. My only couple of beefs with the car is the first 5 minutes of warm up, It wants to buck in first or second gears until it warms up. It just annoying, you would have thought Honda could have reprogrammed the ECM to fix this. I've heard from other message boards this was due to something emissions rated, whatever it is very annoying. My other beef is the auto door locking function. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>High revving motor, can drive like a bat outta hell if you want or you can save gas and drive live a normal civic. I also like the cloth interior. Very supportive seats up front, plenty of space in the back to haul kids to ball games, etc. The best part is that it get close to 30 mpg on the highway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>5600 mile trip AMA to NJ to NC to Austin to AMA: 37.54 mpg; highway portion: 38.73; city (incl DC rush hr): 30.42. Seats firm, but even a 700+ mile day was fine. Pushing it on NC 80 from I-40 to Blueridge Pkwy (posted 45 mph; most curves 15-20 mph rec) was fantastic: engine, gearbox, clutch, steering feedback, & stable seats combined for the most fun I've ever had driving a car (I'm 65). Car has 2 personalities: economy or fun. I don't think any other car can do both this well under $20K -- particularly with the EX's safety & Honda's reliability. The beige/ivory color combo & sunroof mean minimal AC use. On hwy, recirc the air, keep heat off, & turn AC on/off as needed. Will incr mpg!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the EX Sedan 1 1/2 months ago and have not regretted it. The car is very smooth and has great road handling ability. Gas mileage is very good. The quality of construction does not leave much if anything to be desired. When you shut the door you can feel you are in a solid car. Looked at the MX-3 and Corolla and the Civic won hands down. It is a nice car to take out onto the highway and and nice to zip around town in. The interior is roomier than expected for a small car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like the new Civic. It is comfortable and gets great milage. The only time I drive this car is to go to work, "87 miles each way". I keep close track of mileage and I see 37.4 to 38.25 MPG highway. I only have 2 issues with the car. The left rear tire cups or wears unevenly. Dealer said its not the cars fault. Had to replace it at 15,500 miles. I thought Honda fixed this problem already. The 2006 and 2007 civics including hybrids had rear suspension control arms that built wrong. No recall but they will replace them if you take it back. The only other issue is the LX radio sounds kind of tinny. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased the civic two weeks ago, switching from a 1997 Honda Accord EX. I always found my Accord to be very reliable and well equipped, but at first I looked at companies outside of Honda including Ford, Volvo, Toyota, Scion, and Mazda. After test-driving these other vehicles, I realized how much more quality there is in Hondas. I have enjoyed every minute of my new civic, especially the gas mileage. Being that my Accord was an older model, gas mileage was average and I can really feel the difference. Even with gas at a high, it only costs me less than $45 to fill up. Love the speedometer. It was definitely hard to get used to at first, but can't live without it now. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was considering the ever so popular Mazda3 in this class, but the 2008 Civic definitely met my expectations. Excellent performance driving for its engine power, stylish interior, one of the highest fuel economies for non-hybrids, and tons of extra features (EX model) has given me a smile every time. My advice for those stuck deciding between a Mazda3 and a Civic: there is a performance difference that Mazda3 wins only for its V6 model. The I4 engines for both give comparable performance but the Civic gives more MPG, legroom for rear passengers, and better quality interior. Save the money on gas to buy a sports car later, if you are in this bracket you shouldn't compromise!</TEXT>

I like the two-tier gauge design, although it took a few days to get used to. I also like the fact that there is no radio antenna sticking up anywhere. The daytime running lights saved me on insurance. There are lots of little features that are cool; such as the automatic door locking/unlocking feature, telescoping steering wheel, etc. My mileage is 37 MPG with 80 percent highway driving.

<TEXT>I purchased my civic a few months ago in order to find a reliable replacement for my truck, which was on its last leg. Over time, I've come to appreciate the civic more and more. With only 2000 miles on the odometer, I'm averaging around 28 mpg in the city and nearly 38 on the highway. I purchased the EXL model in dark red with tan leather. The car feels solid and looks beautiful. Our family previously owned a 2002 civic and this model is a great improvement! The car was tuned for fuel economy and not performance, so it tends to buck a bit if I accelerate hard from a dead stop. However, I'm saving nearly $30 a week in gas, so I have no complaints. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats in the EXL are very comfortable on long road trips and have great lumbar support. The trunk is roomy and provides room to move large cargo when the backseats are folded down. The two-tiered dash was a bit unusual at first, but I've grown to love it - especially when driving at night.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Getting rid of my Tacoma due to gas prices was hard. Best truck made. As sad as it is to say , you can't go wrong with a Honda or Toyota and with gas prices soaring, the Civic is much better looking than the Corolla. Yes, they both make cars with better gas mileage, but you still have to like what you drive. That's why I chose the Civic Si. I've only owned it for about a week, but the engineering is second to none. Some of the interior parts are a little cheap, but what do you want for $21,500? Great car if you're looking for fuel economy and still want some performance. Just know: you have to use premium fuel, so that negates some of your fuel savings.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a Civic Hybrid a few weeks ago and have put ~1880 miles on it thus far. The mileage keeps getting better as you learn to drive it. For the 1880 miles I am getting an overall of 46.3 mpg. I do a lot of highway driving, but amazingly, I usually see the mileage go up after I get off the highway. I have curbed my "need for speed" on the highway (usually travel somewhere between 62 and 68 mph - I used to drive my Audi at a steady 74 mph when I wasn't speeding)and am really into trying to get the maximum mileage. I've totally enjoyed driving it while the gas prices keep going up. Makes you feel like you made a good decision in getting it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the LX 2-door to replace my wife's 20K-miles-per-year Explorer. I honestly thought we'd never buy a NEW car again but we did the math and with the cost of fuel this thing darn near pays for itself as a replacement for the low-MPG Explorer. We had Hondas before having children and now that we're "near-empty-nesters" don't need the SUV so much. After a few tankfuls we've averaged 32.7 mpg in COMBINED city/hwy driving!!! The 2-door seems roomier every time we drive it. My hockey gear didn't eat up much trunk space and hockey sticks have plenty of room with the fold-down rear seatback. It is a BLAST to drive, in traffic or on the highway. Might be more fun with a manual tranny. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I needed a new car. We have owned 7 Accords since 1987, the latest being a 2002 Accord EX. We wanted Honda quality, reliability, and resale value, but needed better fuel economy (we got "only" 25 MPG highway with the 2002 Accord EX). We have had our red Civic EX for 2 weeks now, and love this car. This is a sharp looking car. It has a sun roof, alloy wheels and anti-lock brakes. The highway ride is smooth and acceptably quiet, although a couple of bumps on bridges on I-89 in Vermont were a bit jarring. For a trip from Boston to northern Vermont and halfway back which included mixed city, highway, and country driving, we got 36.5 MPG, on only our 3rd tankful of gas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Having just traded my 2001 Civic EX for the new 2008 LX I can truthfully say that this car is a comfortable pleasure to drive. Road noise has been reduced as well. The first thing I noticed was the performance over the 2001. It was much livelier and with the 5 speed automatic, the engine runs considerably slower at high speeds and has plenty of passing capability. Fuel economy is great, first tank fill got me 38 mpg 20% city and 80% highway) I commute 50K a year in California so the gas mileage and comfort are a big plus for me. I would highly recommend the Civic for those folks looking for both economy and comfort.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Now that I have owned the car for a month I wanted to add to my previous review. Swapping out the OEM tires was a must. Whether you have the Goodyears or the Bridgestones, both are poorly rated on Tirerack and other sites. I had Custom Coach in Southington, CT move the drivers seat back a few inches ($350) and this has made the car much more comfortable for my 6'2" frame though the seats are not the best. Gas mileage is terrific at 34 to 37 mostly highway at 70-75 mph. Car is relatively refined and fun to drive for an economy car. No regrets trading in my V6 Accord for this car and that is saying something. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Honda has really made a great car in all aspects. First, it drives like a champ. There is no noise at high speeds on the highway. Second, the Nav and EM radio is by far the best. However, Honda needs to make the voice recognition better. It sometimes does not execute the right command. We love the EM radio. I don't know how I lived without it for all of these years. The only complaint that I have is when were turned on the Air for the first Time we smelled rotten egg smell. I spoke with Honda and they said that it could be the catalytic converter.

Most people who have looked at it ask if this is a Hybrid, I guess because the dash looks so unique. I have no issues with the "blind" spots others have reported. The cup holders are the best I've ever seen but I will probably not enjoy cleaning them out. The cruise control works very good and the speeds don't waiver up and down hills like others I've had.

<TEXT>I love my new Civic Hybrid. Traded in my '05 Accord Hybrid which averaged 29 mixed. I now get up to 47 mpg in the civic. My one concern is that sometimes from a dead stop (and I do mean "dead" stop) the car will buck and hesitate as I accelerate. If I let off the gas it will stop and not present a problem.

<TEXT>I have been wanting a Civic Si since before I can remember. Now that I have one, I wish I could return it. It feels like a Cadillac with 2 doors and a 4 cylinder engine. That is, it doesn't feel fast, the suspension is terrible, it never feels comfortable, and I just can't find a good seat position. The cabin feels claustrophobic and cramped and I am not a large person (5'5"). If I could return it, I would. I don't think I'll be keeping this car much longer and will take my losses. I'll give 6 months max. Completely disappointed. Depressed and dissatisfied. I'll probably never get myself to buy another Honda again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased this car a week ago, so obviously this is not a long term perspective review. I drove just about everything out there before buying this great car. This car is pretty well thought out. Roomy, quick, great feel and handling, peppy enough to get the job done. I am a 40 yo and it makes me feel like I'm a kid inside when I drive it; yet its very practical for our family of 4. I have owned a plethora of vehicles; my 04 mustang SVT is the only vehicle I have ever had that is so much fun to drive. It makes you want to drive it; how often do you say that about a car. Honda needs to refine a couple things, but overall, this is a great car. Thoroughly impressed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Feel, ride, handling, rev, stereo, seats (feel), look, layout, 0-90, and the roominess. I was very surprised at the head and leg room for a small car. bottom line for me at $21,100 I got a lot of car for todays market prices. Mazda 3 was a little quicker; but didn't leave the same feel at all. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my Jeep Grand Cherokee for a more gas sufficient car. I was considering getting the Hybrid Civic, but after seeing how the hybrid engine sounded with 3 people inside I decided to go with the Civic LX. I am very happy with the purchase. The LX exceeds my expectations in every way. The only thing that I feel bad about the whole deal is trading in and leaving the old car behind, after so many years together it seems like such a cheap way to go out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Honda Civic LX 4 door sedan (5 speed manual). Overall, it appears to be a great car. It seems to be a notch or so down from my first Civic (1993 bought new). I traded in my 2003 4 door Tacoma P/U due to a wreck and rising fuel costs so I have had a bit of an adjustment. Fit-and-finish is good as typical from Honda. For the price I paid minus my trade in, it was a good trade off.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 4 months of research and looking at the Fit, Yaris, Prius, Corolla, Elantra and Sentra. This was our best financial decision when factoring safety, cost to own, and fuel economy. I love the fact that oil changes are at 10,000 mile intervals. I considered a hybrid, but an oil change for that in Austin is about $50. Factoring the extra $8k, this was more economical, yet still providing excellent fuel economy. I really enjoy my new civic. I only wish I had purchased it sooner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The easy to read dash and speedometer. It was an adjustment, but I like it. The great visibility. MP3 jack, power windows, doors, floor mats were all included w/ the LX. Locked gas tank, 3 keys including a valet key. The key is also the remote. Very different than my Chevy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was in the market for a small sedan that that was fuel efficient, reliable, stylish, and would perform with some pep on the road. After doing some extensive research on-line (which included reading Consumer Reports, Edmunds, KBB,etc., I narrowed it down to the 1) Nissan Sentra 2) Mazda 3) Toyota Corolla, and 4) Honda Civic. After completing all of the test drives, the Civic Si was the hands down winner! The Civic fit and finish were best is class, the interior is well laid out and is both comfortable and stylish. The 6 speed manual transmission is smooth as silk and I am thrilled with the overall performance on both the city streets and the highway!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Si Sports suspension hugs the road and feels like that from a more expensive car; 350 watt sound system is incredible ; avg of 28 MPG overall!!; Ipod Aux Jack ; sweet driver and passenger seats that are comfortable and supportive; melodic sound of engine revs ; overall an INCREDIBLE CAR!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Honda makes great cars. We've owned a Pilot since 2003 and aside from the mileage, it's fantastic. Needed a car with better mileage, though. Hence the Civic. With three kids, the Civic is ideal for running around town, and also long trips. This is my wife's car, but I love the leather and moonroof and it's got a fairly good stereo. Recently drove to Albany and back (around 450 miles total) and averaged about 35.5 mpg - on the NYS Thruway averaging around 73 mph. Mileage would probably be around 38 if driven at 60 mph. I have no complaints about this car. We bought the extra warranty for added peace of mind, but I have confidence in Honda -- doubt we'll ever use it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outstanding mileage. Twice as good as the Honda Pilot. The Leather seats are very comfortable. Seat heaters will come in handy in the winter (Upstate, NY). Moonroof is very nice, interior overall is very nice. Handling is good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having driven both, and now owning the Civic for a few weeks, I think the Civic Hybrid beats the Prius in roominess, handling and performance, with no penalty in gas mileage. This is a stylish, comfortable car that requires no sacrifice and pays dividends at the gas pump, and to the environment. This car replaced a 2005 CR-V, which I loved, but my gasoline consumption is down 50%. Way to go Honda!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded out of a V6 Accord due to my long daily commute and gas prices. Got 37 MPG first tank - 80% highway. This is a nice little economy car that is well equipped and reasonably entertaining to drive. I am 6'2" and could use a little more seat travel and the seats themselves won't be fun on long trips but that isn't what I bought the car for. The OEM Goodyear tires were "squishy" and didn't inspire confidence around corners or on the highway. I already swapped them out and am far more pleased with the replacements. My Accord had Michelin Pilot Exalto's and they served me well. The drive train is relatively refined and the 5 speed manual is less notchy than the 6 speed in my Accord.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned the car for a little over a month now and I love it. We also own a 02 Civic EX sedan and having gotten used to it over the past 6 years the Si is worlds ahead in terms of performance and handling. The exterior styling, IMHO, is the best looking Honda currently available. The dash, although large, makes me feel safer. 27 MPG average which is almost as high as the rated highway MPG. The engine and exhaust notes are addictive! It is quiet in normal driving but comes alive both in performance and aurally when you want it to. The car accommodates my family with ease and can also serve as my toy when I am alone. My only disappointment is that the plastics scratch. Get one you'll love it</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my first Honda after doing much research on the fuel economy of cars. I bought it new with six miles on it and have had problems with it drifting to the right. I have had it in four times already. First time they did a front end alignment which had failed. It still pulled to the right. Returned that day and they switched tires from rear to front and said it was a radial pull and they put all new tires on it. It continues to drift and now they are telling me it is the road and all Hondas drift to the right. It never pulls left. They also scratched my paint up on the visit with their complimentary wash. Very unhappy!!!</TEXT>

Didn't think I would be a fan of the high revving engine but I am now. I highly recommend to take it for a test drive and make sure you open it up to get the full effect. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2008 Civic LX has 18K miles on it. Wintertime gas mileage around town is about 34, summertime 36-37. Today I filled up full and got 40.1 mpg with all around-town driving. With highway driving, using the cruise control and making sure that RPMs don't exceed 2,000 (so about 60 mph)I can regularly get 47+ mpg. If I increase speed to 65 mph, mileage drops to about 42 mpg, so I lose about 1 mpg for each mph over 60 mph I drive. I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money for a hybrid. This car is a gem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fuel economy is great. The car gets about 33-35mpg in spirited driving and can do up to 42mpg if driven economically. I would prefer a manual transmission but the automatic performs very well for a commuter car. I always use 87-octane gas, Royal Purple synthetic motor oil and a K&N reusable air filter in the stock intake. I have a sub in the trunk and heavier speakers upfront that probably cancel out the mpg gains from the oil/filter. Worth it to me. Undoubtedly the car?s aerodynamic car- forward design contributes to its fuel economy as well, but the thick pillars front and rear cause large blind spots making lane changes a bit more risky than I?d like.</TEXT>

Air conditioner, heater are fantastic. Is garaged, but even sitting outside in subzero temp days after getting off work, starts great! The car got around on snow and ice fine! Only thing I'd rather have is a higher bumper in front, I've scraped the bottom a few times pulling too close to a curb while diagonal parking, and on ice berms when slushy roads refroze. And backing out of diagonal parking spot when next to a long pickup truck can be tricky. But other than that, LOVE IT!!! Vacationed with 2 teenage boys in backseat, enough leg room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I commute 120 miles a day, so gas mileage was of paramount importance. I have always owned Hondas and loved them-except for this one. The passenger/driver sun visors have broken 3 times. The paint is blistering and peeling off the bumpers. The windshield is VERY long, prone to cracking and the sun visor will take up what little cargo space there is. The rear child tethers are so close to the seat, you cannot use them. I was informed today the brakes need replacing every 20-25,000 miles since all the 2008 have a new brake system to eliminate braking noise that results in 1/2 the usual brake life. I'd rather have the noise...and a different car. $300 every 8 months is pricey.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded my 2006 Honda Civic SI coupe in for something that was cheaper, less to insure, and something I didn't have to put premium gas in. So I decided to get a new Coupe LX civic. I got it in an automatic, I was getting a little tired of driving a stick anyways. Very nice for the price. I got mine at less than invoice price, thanks to my helpful Honda dealership. Love the tan interior, although I think it will get dirty fast. Only thing I don't like is when I put the car in park my door unlocks itself. I mean what if I was shopping and someone came up and mugged me as soon as I parked? Just don't think it's a great feature, since I would think most people who buy this car are female.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cute sporty design, great gas mileage, hubcaps that are 16 inches, not the standard 15, clean crisp interior design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great highway cruiser - if you travel long distances, this is a great way to get there cheaply. 43 mpg on the 1st fill-up, I expect more when it breaks in completely. Rented a Prius (got 44 mpg with it) and shopped one as well - the Civic stickers for less, Honda is dealing on the sticker price, and you still get $1050 in cash back from the Feds - what's not to like? The Prius is a nice car, this is less expensive and equally as nice. I like the "normal" Civic look as opposed to the unique design of the Prius. The Prius has a bit more room inside, and I like the fold down back seats and rear space. The Honda can carry 850 lbs (pass + cargo) the Prius 800 lbs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the blue interior in my silver, much less bland than the Prius. No Gee-Whiz gimmicks, just a straightforward mpg monitor and real gas savings. Standard radio is better than the Prius. Instrument lighting is better than the Prius as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After months of test drives and research, the Civic is far and away better than anything else in this segment. As a commuter car, nothing beats the Civic. I don't know why some people complain about ride quality on the highway. I had to push it to 90 mph until it got a little 'choppy'. It's got to be one of the safest cars on the road with dual airbags and side curtain airbags. The little extras like the oil change percentage, outside temp. gauge, adjustable armrest are what puts this car into a league of it's own! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Honda vehicle and so far it has been a great pick. I picked the 2008 Honda Civic because it has great features. My last car was a 2002 Chrysler Sebring (what a mess!!). After driving a Chrysler Sebring, I wanted a car that was dependable; especially after dealing with the transmission problems for five years. I searched several nights on the internet about Honda products and have seen great comments about their products. So, there I was on a Honda dealership lot and I know I have made a great choice. The only problems I have so far, is the key not having the trunk release button on it and for some reason when the windows are down, the air is not circulating properly.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Save on gas. I filled my tank up with gas and drove 300 plus miles and the car was still on half full. Now, you know that I was so tickled and especially at the ones that was at the gas stations filling up their SUVs and other big cars.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car two weeks now and I've put 600 miles on it. I got the Fiji Blue Pearl coupe. This car is really fun to drive. I got 28 mpg on my first tank of gas. I haven't been letting it rev high. I'm really impressed with how the car handles. The build quality is great, as Honda is known for. I've added a few things to this Civic. I put 18" chrome Acura TL wheels on it, HID headlights, and LED taillights. I've had a lot of vehicles. I've had BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, and Acura. With gas prices going higher, and the economy going lower, this is a wise choice if you still want fun and don't want a hybrid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I shopped quite awhile for an economical car that would provide us with years of durability. We narrowed the choices to the 2008 Honda Civic and the 2009 Toyota Corolla. It was a close competition especially since Toyota was offering 0% financing on the Corolla and Honda had no incentives on the Civic. Contrary to the previous poster, I found the Corolla to be very refined for a compact. The XLE model was our favorite and it does include alloy wheels, bluetooth, traction control and NAVI. The Civic won us over with reliability (Corolla first year of new model) and fuel economy as well as engine performance. The interior at least on the EX seemed a little more refined.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband and I purchased our second Civic about a week ago. Since the very first moment I drove it off the lot, I have heard incessant rattling. I tried various things to get it to stop like moving the headrests, slamming the back seat to make sure it was locked in. Nothing worked. I scheduled a service appt. this past Friday and was told, yes, they acknowledge the rattle and even went so far as to tell me it is coming from the seat belt tensioner, but that it cannot be fixed. Listening to the rattle takes all the fun out of driving the car. I want to be excited about my new car, but I can't. We own a 2007 civic also and that is very quiet - no rattles. Shouldn't they fix it?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got this one for the wife, who puts about 2000 miles/month on it. I liked it so much I got one too, but manual. Traded an '04 350Z so I could drive all year in Idaho. The stick version feels quite a bit quicker than the auto. A friend and I both have both trannys. The EPA lies, the manual gets 2-3 mpg more (30/35 vs 32/37) if it matters. Drove the Si w/ intent to buy it but this wonderful engine isn't special til over 6 grand up to 8500 rpm. This is not useful unless you're a wannabe racer. I'd like the power in the midrange like my Z. So the Si is a great handling car with nothing to offer mature drivers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall should be very worth while, the body reminds me of the older Lotus Esprit with the long racked windshield. While having to use premium I still already see the cost savings of using this car. Mileage is always in the upper 20's - lower 30's, and this is the sports model in there line, with gas approaching $4 a gallon the couple of cents for premium out ways the difference. It handles very well, corners great, even now I am still amazed at how spunky this car is, it's not the big "Hemi-V8" but let the rpms work for you and you can fly. I see people complain there is no power, my response is you don't know how to handle the car then, and you shouldn't drive one then...</TEXT>

As a former Ford man who always trashed Honda, I have to say I LOVE THIS CAR! The gas mileage is incredible for the amount of fun you can have. I'm 5'11'' and I feel totally comfortable in it driving for hours. Not to mention, the VTEC in it is plenty powerful enough stock - let alone the abundance of aftermarket parts. The 8th generation Civic is a winner for sure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a Mazda RX-8 6spd,(my wife had problems driving a manual after breaking her foot last fall) the Civic was a major step down. It's a nice looking car, but it's weak and handles terribly (very choppy ride at highway speed) compared to what I was used to driving. The speedometer placement is very unnatural and distracting especially at night. If all you need is a reliable high mileage commuter, this may work for you, but if I had another chance, I'd more likely buy a Corolla.</TEXT>

WITH leather, WITH navigation. vs. the corolla. theres just no comparison. the leather definitely brings the car "to the next level".

I was hesitant to consider the new Civic after having had an older model as a loaner when getting my Del Sol worked on and I found it to be flimsy and loud but this new generation Civic is a charmer! I went to the dealership to try out the new Honda Fit as a supplemental car to my Del Sol which has over 100K miles on it and test drove the Civic, too, and fell in love.

<TEXT>I traded in my 4wd SUV for a 2008 Civic EX w/nav for the purposes of reducing my monthly payment and cutting my fuel consumption. Mission accomplished. I figure to save around $400 a month (about $150 on payment and $250 on gas). I fully expected to sacrifice power, comfort, and cargo space. While I did lose a little power, the Civic is surprisingly and deceptively roomy on the interior. And the large trunk and fold-down rear seats allow for more than adequate cargo capacity. Adequate power, plenty of room (even for me at 6' tall and 220 lbs), and an interior (with voice activated navigation and digital gages) that gives off a "luxury car" feel leaves me with no regrets whatsoever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun to drive? That's Because my Civic is averaging 32-35 mpg, now I can actually afford to drive. I drive approximately 70% highway and 30% city and back roads. Our highways are hilly here in West Virginia and my city driving includes many steep hills. In flatter terrain it should approach 40 mpg. The Civic is sporty / fun to drive and handles most driving conditions well. I actually look forward to driving it. Value: Hey, I did the comparisons too, it has one of the highest MSRP's in its class. Check the private party sale value of a 2006 Civic LX AT with 60K miles. The true market value of $12K is more than the asking price of new 2008 models in this segment less the Corolla.</TEXT>

Back seat was exceptionally uncomfortable for three passengers. Hondas used to have nearly flawless, logical interior design but the company just went too cheap on this model.

<TEXT>I bought my LX Sedan about a month ago and really like it. I put a pair of wrist (sweat) bands around the emergency brake. The brake hurt my leg due to its placement but now it's fine with the pad. I live in a very cold environment which kills MPG but I am getting 30 MPG Combined City/Hwy. The motor is new, and I'm sure MPG will improve when it's breken in and the weather warms up. It has plenty of power, I have owned vettes and trans ams, and I'm happy with the acceleration of my new Honda. It's not noisy on the highway like some have reported. It is a small car and you do hear the road a little, and you feel all the bumps, but as I pass the gas stations ($3.39 a gallon) I am smiling! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Ever do something then get the feeling you just did something really bad? This is a basic LX, I've only had it 3 weeks so far, but am finding things out I hate. When you open the rear windows it creates a horrible loud noise that almost caused me to wreck. It hurts our ears so badly. I asked my dealer about it and 7 people jumped up really working me over saying ALL Honda's do it and so do all other vehicles. They are aware of the defect and have a bulletin about the buffeting noise. I'm telling you, the Sonata didn't do it and neither did my 626. The interior is cheap. If you get scratches you're just out of luck. Mine came with them on the steering column. Really poor stereo.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had a Pontiac Formula, Chevy Cavalier, Acura 3.0 CL and now the royal blue Honda Civic! Beats all of the others. I test drove others but was SO impressed with it I had to take it. I got the car out the door for 20k. Although I miss a v6, the engine is peppy. Drove it from DC to SC within the first week! 37 MPG averaging 70+ mph and sunroof/windows open most of the way. Handled great and study. reliability cannot be beat. Get the leather...seat heaters are great and the car comes with a bunch of standard features...stereo isn't bad either. I would highly suggest! Car shifts with ease too...really an all around great car. Actually roomy too...size of older accords.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Civic?s that are made in Canada has very poor fit and finish. The hood on the left and right fender would not be even, other panels on the car would be off on each side and also the bumper in the back. If they can't even make that right, just imagine the engine and the transmission components. ?Honda owner check your civics and you would be able to tell the difference on the body panels are not even on the right and left sides of the car?. I asked the dealer sales people and their replied ?they don?t know why?. However the civic hybrids are made very well, those are made in Japan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently traded in my 2005 Acura TL for a 2008 Honda Civic EX-L. I know, why would you do that? Well, I drive about 30K a year,my TL had 60K miles and it was time to either keep it till death or trade. I could have got another TL or similar car, but the premium gas and the mileage were starting to hurt. So I went hunting for something simpler and more economical. I considered a hybrid, but the numbers just don't work. The Civic is a good choice. It is peppy and fun to drive, it has everything you need. It's comfortable and very economical. I'm averaging 31+ mpg, I've had it 3 weeks and have over 1700 miles already. I added the leather, I think it brings the car to the next level. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car replaced a 1993 Subaru Legacy with 175000 miles on it. The Subaru (my third) was reliable and sturdy but the gas mileage wasn't great. The gas mileage on the Honda has been terrific and I like the 5 speed automatic (I spend a lot of time in traffic). However, I'm not impressed with the quality of the interior materials. There is a frequent squeaking noise from the dash/windshield junction, as if the windshield was not set in correctly. The dealer can hear the noise but has been unable to locate the source of the problem. After two months the plastic on the door panels and dash already have permanent scratches despite careful handling. I never had this type of problem with a Subaru.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the interior of the car. It handles very well and enjoy the ride. Now, when comparing the exterior and interior design of the Civic Si and the Civic from Europe, you can see that the North American Honda Civic needs much improvement. Nonetheless, the Civic Si compared to other U.S automobiles of its class, is far beyond its competition. It would be great to see the European Civic in the U.S as a special edition for 2009, or as an alternative option for the Civic Si. Honda U.S is the only to offer 2 types of Civic Si's: the sedan and the coupe. Then, I must say, why not introduce a third, a hatchback! Nonetheless, I love my Civic Si and will be mine for a very long time :) </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just traded a 2006 Jetta Diesel for this beauty. What a great car. I am especially glad now that diesel is over 4.00 here. I saw an earlier post that trashed the transmission....mine is flawless. Smooth shifting...I was really surprised by the low rpms at 62 mph, around 2000. I am 6', and this car is super comfortable. Gas mileage is a little less than the jetta, but it will more that even out with the price difference. Combined first tank mpg was 36. I have a 07 yukon xl, and an 06 2500 chev duramax, this is by far my favorite to drive. Huge trunk, nice stereo, I really love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am the type of person who researches everything going into purchasing a car. After 2 months of researching cars my buddy and I came across the Honda CIVIC SI Sedan. This Car is amazing!! I will never not own a Honda after this car and this car is fast for being a four door sedan. The car shifts great, when it RPMS passed 6000 VTEC kicks in and its amazing. For the price, I paid $19300 but I had to include extended warranties over 7 years 150,000 miles, that alone was 4500 dollars and with taxes, all in all, paid $25000. This is a great car, gas I am getting 32 highway and 27 city, comfortable seats, and once you drive it you will never want to drive anything else. GREAT CAR!! </TEXT>

The eighteen inch mugen rims look awesome in the graphite look against the fiji blue paint which is by far the best color on the civic si. Great gas mileage so far about 27 mpg. Wonderful exhaust note especially when it hits vtec. About as fun as it can get for 28k which is a bit steep for any civic but i know the resale will be great go ahead buy one you will love it addictive</TEXT>

<TEXT>I only have 300 miles on my new Civic Hybrid, and I love it. it is the most fun to drive car I've had since my 88 280-ZX. I had it up to 85 on the freeway and it held the road like a champ. I took it up a steep mountain road and it didn't falter or slow down a bit. I haven't figured out all the electronic stuff on the NAV system yet but that will surely keep me interested for awhile. My gas mileage has not been 45 but more like 35 but I guess that's due to the way I drive. I did get 50 downhill (ha ha). it's too much fun driving to drive it like a granny. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the kind of car you look forward to driving every day. I'm at about 400 miles now and look forward to every time I can get onto a curvy road. Daily driving around town is just fine, but I just calculated my miles/gallon (city) and it came in at 19.38? I'm hoping this will get better once the engine is broken in. My only other complaint would be the seat comfort. I have a herniated lower disk in my back and the shape of the seat is kind of harsh on my back...once again I'm hoping this gets better as the car breaks in. Other than that, this car is awesome! I was also considering a 2005 Lexus IS 300 w/ 27K miles (for the same price), but the Si just seemed like a better choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had my car a couple weeks so it's hard to comment on things like MPG. Still on the first tank of gas, and I've gotten 170+ miles and the gauge is still a tad bit above 1/2. But everything is great about this car. The interior is so much nicer than the other cars I tested, but I did notice a couple small fit and finish issues, but nothing major. I will have to get used to not being able to see the hood of my car so it'll be a bit of a pain to parallel park for a while here. I'll also have to mention the manual gearbox as it has a pretty short and precise shifting action and feels good. The clutch is pretty user friendly for a newbie like me and overall the car feels pretty sporty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gearbox, clutch, gauges/speedometer/tachometer...very pleasing to look at when lit up! Also like all the storage spaces in the car as well as the rear seat latch in the trunk. Steering wheel is small-ish and feels good in my hands.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We wanted to go green. We didn't know how we'd adjust coming from 2 new Audi A4 quattros (a 98 and 05). We got this and we don't regret it. It has enough zip. It's comfortable & roomy enough for 4 adults. I've only filled the tank 5 times. The first 4 I averaged about 36/37 MPG. This last one I did about 38 MPG. (402 miles on 10.5 gallons). Not bad comparing to my Audi but not the 40/45 advertised. The car was bucking this afternoon. Don't know what it is. I have about 1,500 miles on it now and it's not the first time it's happened. Overall I like the car and like the economy payment and low gas cost. We must all conserve folks. Buy economical. We liked it better than the Prius. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this about car a couple of weeks ago an I just love the fact it gets good gas mileage, but still is nicely appointed. I was looking at other cars like the a used TSX and the new Accord. I opted for this car because of it's great gas mileage and good looks. I have to be honest I live in Chicago and don't drive that much, but when I do I want to know that I'm driving something that gets decent gas mileage. I know I could have probably gotten a used car, but their aren't a lot of used Honda's out there with Nav. I'm very happy that I got this car. The nav has come in handy numerous times. I don't know how I got along without it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Honda Civic LX is a great car. It's fun, flashy, responsive, and great on gas. Love the interior design; the elegant dash, the race inspired steering wheel. The two-tier gauge layout. On top: MPH. Bottom: RPMs and other vitals. They all just come together nicely. The exterior design is great too. Very sporty (I prefer the four door look myself). But wait, there are troubles in paradise. One big problem is the transmission (I agree with the other viewer). It clunks and down shifts gears in an odd way. RECALL! Another problem is the the car's two major blind spots. These are at the driver's 10 and 2 o'clock positions. To make matters worse, the car's horn sounds like a cheap alarm clock.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned a Civic EX 2007 model for 10k miles now, and just traded in another 07 Civic hybrid for the Si. Wow. This thing is like a whole different car than the EX. The car surges forward with throttle input where the EX has a delay and doesn't seem to have near the torque. The Si actually feels quicker than it is. The handling difference between the Si and Ex is even more pronounced. It sticks like glue and feels very "planted" throughout the corners. I absoultely love this car and recommend anyone who is looking at an EX to at least drive one of these if your budget will allow you to take a small jump in price to be able to buy one of these. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, 6spd tranny, handling. This is really that great of a car. I had a 400bhp AWD eclipse for 9 years and I don't really miss it although the power was intoxicating.

<TEXT>This is an awesome little car that is all it is claimed to be. It performs as well as my Civic Hybrid. It has a comfortable ride and is quiet except on highways with those ridges cut in it. The range is a little limited with an 8 gallon fuel tank and the fuel gauge accuracy is marginal at best - an important feature when you only have 8 gallons when full. The fuel economy has been much better than indicated. Overall average for the last 3200 miles of mixed driving has been 35.9 mpg. It has had a reliable 200+ mile range with a 90%+ fill. It would probably do better if the fuel gauge could be relied upon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been a loyal Toyota owner since 1996, but I bought my first Honda because of its clever interior and nice exterior design. It is much quieter in the Civic EX cabin than in the Prius or Corolla cabin. I love the split dash display, the extra storage nooks on the dash and center console, the large windshield. The ride is wonderfully smooth and quiet. I also love the speed-sensitive volume control. The small storage spot under the heater control was just perfect for my Sirius radio, and I love the auxiliary input below the 12-volt outlet. My only real disappointment is the low fuel efficiency. With my Tercel, I was getting 42 mpg composite. With the Civic EX, I get only 33 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to let others know that I love everything about this car except for the automatic transmission. It shifts too harshly while in D. When driving above 25-30 mph and then slowing down or braking under 20 mph, then quickly stepping on the gas, the transmission will jerk or buck forward and you'll hear a very loud clunk sound. It is not a normal jerk at all, it is a very violent jerk and the transmission will clunk. It's pretty bad and I've learned that it's common in all 2008 civics with automatic transmissions. There was a problem with the civic si 3rd gear and there is a problem with the 2008 civic automatic transmission as well. Honda needs to issue a recall ASAP!</TEXT>

The clutch and close ratio gearbox are are light and easy to modulate (third gear can be a little tricky til you get used to it). Doors close with a nice solid thunk and overall the car seems well made. The only issue that I have with the car is that the heated seats are not at all what I am used to. Previous car was a 2003 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS.) My Chevy's seats got hot in seconds and stayed that way, the Honda's barely get warm on high - dealer say they are "operating normally".

I looked at the compact and subcompacts from Chevrolet, Scion, Toyota, Nissan, Saturn, Pontiac, Mitsubishi, Suzuki, Mazda, Hyundai and Kia. The best compliment I can give the car is that I would've still bought for myself even if I didn't have a child approaching driving age. I really love driving it on my work commute.

I just need to get used to the steering and controlling the vehicle. the only problem I have with this car for now, when I have my sunroof open in the highway, the car seem to swerve a bit so I have to close my sunroof a little bit. It seems to swerve once in awhile. What it needs it VSA!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car was the best investment I have ever made. I am a 19 year old, full time worker and college student, so this was a big choice for me to make, but I'm glad I did. Little bit of a blind spot which I knew about before I made the purchase (it's not that bad). People are so impressed with the interior from the gauges all the way to the space and comfort. I have no regrets. I always look at my car and smile, it really is a perfect car for me. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior is unique, the black color I chose has little tiny blue sparkles in the sun, it looks amazing. Interior is roomy, the cupholders is neat because there is a little compartment to cover over them if you dont want them seen. Lots of little compartments. Blue lighting on the gauges.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looking at the most fuel-efficient choices out there, I naturally settled on the Prius and Civic Hybrid (and held onto a secret wish for a Mazda 3 hatchback that could get 40 on the highway). The Prius had an appealing zen-like quality to it, but it just wasn't comfortable for someone my size (6'3"). Acknowledging my natural Hondaphile leanings, I drove the HCH (with some reservations over the supposedly "underwhelming" performance). After that, it was a no-brainer. It accelerates more than well, never once leaving me with that sinking, sluggish feeling. Add to that comfortable seats and billet-like build quality, and I feel I got a premium-class car with 45 mpg for $21.5K. Very happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance (acceleration & steering), tight handling, very solid & quiet structure, comfortable & ADJUSTABLE seats (unlike Prius), $1050 tax credit, the satisfaction that you're acknowledging the kind of driving you really do, not the kind you want to do. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Initially I looked at a lot of cars. This one was at the bottom of my list. I compared it to the Mazda Speed 3 and a Subaru WRX. The engine revs very smoothly in this car but the power when it reached 6,000 rpms is really amazing. The shifter on the Si is buttery smooth. It drives very well even in the snow. I put Nokian tires on it for winter and it goes just great in snow. My wife really likes driving this car so with all that we bought it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the smooth shifter the most it's really nice even in sub zero temps. I also really like the digital speed at the top of the dash. The heater is very strong really can blast the heat. I like the design of the seats very comfortable for long trips over 2 hours.</FAVORITE>

Long story short, went to test drive the CRV again and while waiting on the salesman I looked around the showroom and saw the leather. The seats were incredible. I had no idea about the "extras" that this model had until reading postings about the LX and EX. The car has a lot of room for being a compact car. A lot of storage areas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car handles great with LSD. Acceleration was nothing spectacular when not pushed but it was very smooth in the process. I really liked the futuristic spaceship design on the exterior and interior. It really does stand out from the crowd and yes, you do get stares when sitting in traffic as if they're seeing a UFO. I've also noticed that this car has huge blindspots all around. Exhaust note is nice during warmer days and sounds droning during colder days even with the car fully warmed up. Ergonomics are excellent as it is driver-oriented. Driving impressions of this car is that it is a race car without a race car price tag.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Performance for a 4 cylinder is amazing, hp is designed to kick in at speeds of 30mph or more, great passing power, quiet engine, low torque so acceleration is average. The ex coupe ride is firm, seats are comfortable, they remind me of racing seats that keep you securely in place. Tires are a bit noisy but grip well in dry or wet conditions, avg. grip in snow. Wiper blades are speed sensitive + have a built in rain-x feature that coats your windshield with a rain repellent each time the wipers pass over the windshield. I drive 100% in the city and am getting about 21 mpg, includes warming up my car for 3-5 minutes each morning and accelerating like an old granny.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive! I find myself wanting to go cruising in the car despite high gas prices. Handles like a sports car, planted feel. The engine+ trans. has a unique sound to it, when you accelerate at a low to moderate pace it sounds like the monorail from Disney World. I love that sound! Elegant styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Civic and by leaps and bounds the best. I cross shopped the Prius and GTI and found the former's too soft handling and the latter's prem fuel thirst and economy off-putting. I'd vowed never to get WORSE mileage than my '02 Civic but wanted heated seats, XM and a more planted, composed and quiet ride, in a hatch if possible. The last wasn't to be but on all other counts, the Civic was the best choice out there. It is vastly more quiet than the previous gen. and feels almost as planted as a Euro car. Mileage is 30+ after 1500mi and should improve. I think this is an ideal commuter car with enough creature comforts and fit/finish to compete with cars far more expensive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The two tier dash and wheel controls for the stereo are fantastic. Engine RPM at 65 is just over 2000, which means it's super quiet. The PC Card is great as dealing with an iPod while driving is also unsafe. The fwd visibility is by far this car's best trait. It feels panoramic, open and airy.</FAVORITE>

I was seeking better MPG and more room since I frequently take road trips and don't pack lightly. I wanted something that held its value and wouldn't constantly be in the shop. So far I am THRILLED! I love my Civic more and more every time I drive it! I get a combined 34-38 MPG! I drove it from FL to NC, NC to FL and back again. I averaged about 40-42 MPG! I am also very comfortable when I am driving! I like the fact it's quick and blind spots aren't too bad either. They can be so much worse. Road noise can be pronounced at times.</TEXT>

In the end, it was the build quality and my previous knowledge of Honda reliablity (and a great deal of homework and test driving) that resulted in this Honda sale. I enjoy the peppy drive of the manual transmission and the gas mileage is great (so far, 31mpg in mixed driving). If you read this, stop, and go buy one, you will not regret it!

<TEXT>As a recent college grad, this was my first new car purchase. I spent months (literally) trying to find a something fun/practical/economical/sporty/stylish /etc. all wrapped into one. Before, I drove a '95 Mazda Millenia which was great. My first Honda experience has been amazing so far. I was warned the Si was a true sports car. This is not a lie. Gears 2 through 5 really have some power, especially in the higher RPM's (redlines at 8000). With a little time, the clutch is fairly user friendly. Navigation system is easy to use and the sound system is better than advertised (built in sub really kicks hard). I bought this car to have some fun and so far Honda has delivered.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It was between this car or a 4dr GTI. The ride is amazing. The handling is perfect and responsive. I was in an Altima SER, so going from 261 to 197hp I'm going to have to say it is slow. It has good pick up and it's hard to red-line :). The nav is worth it. I'm a pilot so I have a good sense of direction... thought I'd never use it. Once I played around with it for a while and studied up on it I really learned to enjoy it. The tires could be a little stickier. I do a lot of city driving and I'm getting about 24mpg average and I am shifting around 4500 to 5000 rpm on average. I use the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my Civic EX-L two weeks ago. My previous car was a Maxima so this is very different. The Civic is no longer a cheap car to buy. The final price was over 22K. It is probably worth it though. The coupe is fun to drive and handles the road well. The car gets around 26 miles to the gallon so far in city driving using regular grade gas. Most of the controls are easy to use. The steering wheel is in the way of the tachometer (located on the lower tier of the dashboard). I don't need to see it anyway. The only problems so far are a dashboard rattle and the driver's side door handle keeps loosening. There is also a big blind spot in the coupe.</TEXT>

I was rear ended at 10mph by a Jeep Cherokee and the vehicle suffered a lot of damage. I was told that the steel in the civic is not as strong as other vehicles I guess for weight? Any way not too impressed. Happy I leased it for 24 months and can't wait to get out of the lease. I suggest leasing and if you like the vehicle buy it after the lease is up, if you don't like it you can return it like I will.

I've owned many new cars in my lifetime and never replaced pads under 10k miles. This was a disappointing experience, so I have written a letter to American Honda.

<TEXT>I wrote a review when I had 8K miles on and I have 16K miles now. MPG improved from 21 to 23 just in city driving and highway driving MPG improved from 30 to 33 mpg. Considering DC traffic, I would say 23 miles for Honda is the really good. Again, enough space for everyone in a small family (2 adults+1 child). Enough space in a trunk. A lot of people wrote about noise, but I did not feel it. Since I bought, I spent just 150USD in an oil change and checkup. No problems as of today. Seats and interior is fine. You need to realize that it is a budget type of car. To get a better mileage, keep your RPM in 1300-1600 range in a city, even with it your speed will be around 35-40 mph. We just love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the Hybrid almost 1 yr ago. To date 26,000 miles and it runs fantastic. As for mileage, last summer I was averaging around 50 mpg since I do all highway driving. When winter came it dropped off about 5 mpg. Still beats my pickup truck I traded in. The navigation was my wife's idea and I am so glad she talked me into it. This is the greatest nav I have ever used. Had several hand helds and a Lexus. The only problem I have found is the tires. I have just replaced the stock tires since they were shot at 25000 miles. When I replaced them the tire guy told me I would lose about 2-3 mpg and he was right. I recommend buying hybrid tires.</TEXT>

My Mom bought it for me as a gift when she found out she was terminal :-( I went from a 95 Taurus with 200K and rust up the doors to a 2008 Civic w only 12K! I love driving this car! Only complaint seems to be the gas mileage, way better than the American junk Taurus was, but not as good as my old Honda CRX. The stereo sounds best with really heavy metal like Slayer or WASP or Satyricon. On the highway this thing cruises with LOW ROAD NOISE despite others complaints, I don't get the "road noise" complaint maybe it's cuz compared to my old heap this car is a Rolls Royce!

It handles better than some cars way out of it's price range. rRdes a bit stiff, but that's expected from a performance suspension. I love the exhaust note at pretty much any engine speed.

<TEXT>I've owned 6 Hondas since 1980 and "fell off the wagon" with a V6 Jetta purchase several years ago. Am I ever glad to be back. Looked at the '08 Accord and Camery, but the milage and the EX-L/Navi option sold me on the Civic. I'm getting 28 city over first 3 fill ups. With the mileage, navi, and XM, I can't wait to take it on an extended highway trip. Drove it through an inch ice storm and 7 inch snow fall last week with no problems at all. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Value. Mileage. Style. Reliability (if true to my past Honda experience). Fun to drive. Navi. That solid Honda "thunk" when you close the doors! Amazing Honda paint. 6,000 miles between oil changes.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 7th Honda I have owned and already love it. I sold my 2007 Nissan Altima 2.5SL for this car. I was not happy with the Nissan and did not like the 28 MPG on a 4 cyl engine. The bottom line is Nisaan's are not Honda's.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had mine for almost 3 months now and I still shake my head in disbelief when I look at it. Such aggressive styling on a car this size is rare and in this case very well done. The view of the road is appreciated, but the blind spots are troubling, but I am coming from a Maxima with windows all around and if you actually look and not just rely on mirrors then its fine. I have noticed the occasional rough shift in the transmission and a little hesitation/skipping at idle, but i'm sure its nothing a quick visit to the dealer won't fix. I'm also not a big fan of the fact the rear entry effects the front seat position every time some gets in and out of the back seat. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Two tiered gauge cluster, aux output (doesn't inherently affect sound quality ... thats simply an mp3 vs audio cd issue), and aggressive styling, design of the steering wheel</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car after reviewing and driving all the cars in this class and this was the best value for me. I was just looking for good gas mileage and good reliability. I love driving this car and it gets good gas mileage, so hopefully the reliability will be there over time(because it's a Honda). I'm not quite sure about the stereo built into the dash yet because if I want to upgrade to an aftermarket stereo, it will be almost impossible. The stereo sounds fine though, so an upgrade might not be necessary. The seats are a little uncomfortable, but they seem the same as other sporty cars - it doesn't bother me. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>What an outstanding car. It's quick, quiet and very well equipped. Very fun to drive. I prefered the Civic over the Prius because it is not quasi-futuristic like the Prius. It has a regular key and regular displays. Conversely the Prius display is extremely busy. Plus going from a Jeep Wrangler to a HCH I went from 18 mpg to 43 mpg - quite a savings. BTW - That was my real world mpg after my first tank.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can honestly say that I was very unhappy when my fiancee decided he wanted to trade both of our higher end vehicles in on a new Honda Civic. He had owned a 2000 Civic and loved that car. He kept telling me that I would love the new one more every day. I was skeptical, but he was right. I love this car! The interior is much more comfortable than I expected and a lot bigger too. I love the fact that I can hook my iPod right into it. The exterior is just the right amount of sporty for me. I thought the 4 cyclinder engine would be a problem but it has plenty of get up and go and a very quiet and smooth ride. The best thing, the two-tiered dash with the blue lights. I love that!</TEXT>

<TEXT> Been driving this for less than a month now, it has 1200 miles on it. So far it absolutely amazing. It's really fun to drive, Great care for a good deal. You can always buy more comfortable seat add-ons. Blind spot can be easily fixed. Just adjust mirror to see more of the next lane, so all you have to do is turn head once and look at in mirror. Parking is not an issue, can always reverse and re-park. Kinda huge, but its fine.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>HI on Hybrid</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Got 42.75 mpg on 1st fillup for mixed driving. Almost no difference in ride and performance from regular small car. Funky dash, really deep and low with 2-tiered display that needs getting used to. Long dash makes it impossible to see front end and low dash will hinder long-legged front passengers. Smaller trunk and no flip back seats due to battery pack location. Almost everything is std. including excellent stereo, alloy wheels, tilt steering, cruise control. Please check out a hybrid before buying a regular small or mid- size car. Gas savings and tax credit makes up for price premium. Best of all, you really don't sacrifice in terms of ride and performance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With the gas price rocketing and the need of replacing my 02 Land Rover Freelander I decided to go for a hybrid. Decided quickly to go for the Honda Civic for a simple reason. I have long legs and I couldn't fit in the Prius. The Prius steering is not telescopic. The 08 Honda Civic Hybrid is great, I decided to get the nav which is by the way a great system very easy to use and the system even understand my foreign accent (french). Because of my back problems I needed to get a very comfortable car. The freelander was comfortable, the Civic is even more comfortable. The seats and the driving position are great. The gas mileage is excellent 44 MPG for combine driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 2008 Civic Hybrid! Great gas mileage 46 with combo hwy and city driving! Great handling! Good pickup - way better than the 2007 Camry I owned/endured for 6 months before getting rid of it and buying the Hybrid! The Civic Hybrid is quiet and well built. The gas engine shuts down when stopped to save gas! A major plus for traffic jams or a slow crawl in to work! Interior is spacious - only a few inches smaller than the 2007 Camry! Backseat is fairly roomy - not huge, but certainly adequate. Interior styling is nice - two tiered dash with digital mph readout, mpg calculator, outside temp, etc. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great gas mileage. $2100 tax credit (not a deduction - actual cash back) until the end of the year. Fun to drive. Small windows near sideview mirrors add a lot of light and decrease blind spots! Nice sound system with MP3 connection - much better than Camry's! Front arm rest is adjustable!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The SI is all that I hoped for. Its fun, its practical, and best of all, it sounds orgasmic when you fondle the accelerator in any gear. Even cruising around town you hear the moan of the Farrier sounding exhaust. Some may ask if its worth the extra cost than the EX, the answer is yes. You do have to rev it to get all the HP out of it, but the car sounds like it has no problem going to 8000rpm. Even in the low rpms its peppy and pleasing. Its roomy enough to fit my 6'5" frame. You will not find a better value in this class than the SI. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent stereo, seating position, engine feel, exhaust sound, looks, and the unique interior design. Honda is taking the lead in designing something new for the interior and it works great. You will find passerbys sneaking a peak into the cabin to see your guage layout. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I currently have about 800 miles on this car and computer indicates average of 48mpg which is a few mpg's lower than calculated fuel economy. Coasting in neutral on downhills will improve mpg. I had to change driving habits to get the high fuel economy. Driving like a granny also means I am less stressed out driving. The dealer had the tire pressure set to 25 psi which is very low. Once I increased to 40 psi, my mpg increased by about 10%. Back seats are comfortable and roomy. Styling is beautiful. Handling is also excellent. I test drove a Prius which I also liked but the Civic beats the Prius in styling and handling, as well as pricing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I can find only 2 flaws with the new 2008 Honda Civic Coupe, EX-L, 2D, Automatic: (1) horrible blind spot where backseat windows/frames meet. Must have blindspot mirrors. (2) Seatbelts tend to hit me in the neck rather than over my shoulder. I'm 5'5". Also I don't know if the radio/navi system is bluetooth compatible. It should be for what it costs. Other than that, this car is perfect for a small, sporty, nice designed car. Leather seats are very comfortable. Back seat is even comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very particular about cars and this Civic exceeds my expectations. I opted for the EX L with a manual transmission and absolutely love it. Interior is very nice especially compared to the other cars I've owned and the ones I test drove before purchasing this one. Stereo has a nice sound, seats are super comfortable-love the wrap around feature. Easy for me to get in and out of the car. Like the button that remotely pops trunk. Manual transmission is smooth. Steering is nice and easy. Handles corners well. Fold down rear seats are great. For the price, this is an excellent car and value. If you want BMW features then you will have to pay a BMW price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Honda. I loved the other cars (Accords) and bought the Civic mainly to increase gas mileage due to long commute and high marks for reliability and safety. But, there are several things that are truly annoying. The main problem is the front seats are very uncomfortable. After 45 mins of driving my back was hurting due to the hardness of the seat and the way it pushes in your sides to mold you into the seat. There's no "give." Another big problem is the side door frame blocking you view while driving and especially while turning. Not being able to see the front of the car (end of the hood) is a big problem in trying to park, turn etc. Maybe you eventually get used to it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is great. Reliability and safety factors were the selling point for me. Many have commented against the split level dash with speedometer up higher. Actually it's a good idea once you get used to it. Easier to see and doesn't take that much of glance to check it while driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second new Civic in two months! After driving my first new 2007 for 3 weeks, a drunk hit me on the driver's side. The side air bags went off perfectly and I walked away from my totaled car. I guess this speaks to the car's safety. Since I purchased an end of 2007 Civic and I liked the car, I went ahead and purchased a 2008-same exact model/color. The new 2008 differs from the 2007 with the addition of a handy tire pressure monitor (which went off a couple of days) and the absence of a key entrance for the for the trunk. Very fun to drive. Excellent handling and braking. Good acceleration. Mileage so far has been 31 (city/hwy). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The steering wheel control for the radio is very convenient. Quieter than I thought. 5 spd shifter is as smooth and easy as cutting thru butter. I did a lot of research on-line and test driving several cars. Beats the Sentra, Corolla, tC. Better trunk than Mazda3, and less costly than VW. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my fourth Honda, following a '91 Civic, a '96 Accord, and an '05 CR-V. I traded in the Accord for this Civic and was a little disappointed in how "hard" the seats and interior space feel compared to an eleven-year- old car. I know the cars are in two different segments; still, I would've liked to discover that that decade plus brought more refinement. This Civic feels much the way my '91 Civic felt back then when it was new. Nevertheless, it is reasonably comfortable and roomy enough for a six-footer and his 5'11" wife and their two children. The manual shifter is smooth, and the engine feels strong for a car this size. Especially pleasant is the handling; it rides more like a Jetta.</TEXT>

The leather interior interior has a high quality feel and should last a long time. The stock stereo has a nice full sound. I did compare it to the Mazda 3 S Grand Touring Sedan and despite what the specs say, the Civic EX-L feels larger inside from a front and rear leg room perspective.

<TEXT>I was ready to buy something in the $30K+ range, when both of my parents bought new 2007 Civic 4 doors. After driving theirs, I was very impressed and decided the car to get for overall reliability and gas mileage was the Civic. I waited for the 2008 version with the leather and decided to get the coupe for the better stereo system. I have had this car for one week now, and I absolutely love it! The car drives smoothly, accelerates quickly, and looks great outside and inside (Silver with black leather). I find myself going for drives at night just to sit in the car and drive it. The car feels solid and able on the road. It has exceeded my expectations for a car in this price range.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wrote a post below after 8K miles, now at 26K. The MPG for this car have steadily improved over time though there are seasonal variations (better in summer worse in winter). Anyway I have kept detailed mileage records and this car has done 45.9 MPG (calculated) for the life of the vehicle. I find the calculated is always ~2 mpg more than the dashboard reading. Breakdown is 48.4 MPG Summer & 42.5 MPG Winter. For the statisticians out there the overall sample size (tankfuls) is 61 and the overall mean is 45.9 MPG with a 95% confidence between 45.0 & 46.8. Std Dev is 3.56. MPG is still improving, and expecting to hit average 50 MPG per tank once Spring warm-up arrives.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is simply FANTASTIC. I love every feature of it, its sexy, sporty, handles terrific, has great gas mileage and the price is fair for all the feature you get especially the EX model. It has a very strong chassis too. Once I slammed a Cadillac CTS on the back at a full 30 mph without hitting the breaks, I thought I had totaled the car, but only the bumper got scratched. INCREDIBLE. I was totally surprised by that. I think this car is definitely the best one there is out there in its category. Anyone one considering buying one, don't hesitate. I've only done oil changes to it and its been great to me.. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If Honda made a 90-93 Accord again I would buy in a second. My 93 with nearly 300K miles ran like the day I bought it. It got better mileage than my 08 civic with same driving routine. Best I've gotten is 27.5 mpg. Civics air conditioner varies temp abut 20 degrees. Barely keeps car cool in So. CA summers. Nearly impossible to clean inside of front and rear windows which haze over from all the plastics out gassing in summer heat. Lots of road noise. Very disappointed overall. Dealer can't find anything wrong. Surprise, surprise. This is my 5th and probably my last Honda. I also have an 03 Odyssey with which I get 22 to 24.5 mpg cruising at 80. </TEXT>

<TEXT>All future Honda buyers, BEWARE! I bought my car merely a year ago and since about 6 months ago, it has been making sounds like there is a horse under the hood. Last week, it LOST most of what little power it had (could only go 25mph) and the dealer said that nothing was wrong with it. Then, 5 days later, the damn thing stalled in the middle of an intersection. I had to get out and push then have it towed! And when I take it in for repair, the car doesn't act up so they say that everything checks out fine. I can't sell it because the economy is so bad and plus it WILL give trouble to it's new owner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 5th Honda. Noticed with the last Honda that quality isn't what it used to be. I have had my current Honda Civic 08 car in the shop 3 times, and I only have 6000 miles on it right now, and they still can't figure out why the car doesn't start sometimes-same thing happened on the last Honda. Ride is very noisy and there's a tick at times that dealer says in the fuel injection-it's too loud and distracting. Seats aren't comfortable. Switch to adjust driver side window is poorly placed. Hondas used to be great cars; unfortunately, I think quality and dependability has gone down. I'm also disappointed in the fuel economy for a small car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This little car is a gem. My first criteria was MPG, but I got way more than I expected. It was hard to find one with a manual, but I am old school (52 yrs) and prefer it by far. After over 7000 Alaska miles I have averaged 33.7 MPG. On the highway in summer I have reached over 46. With a set of General Altimax Arctic studded tires my Civic sticks to the gnarly Alaska winter roads like glue. Snow tires cost 5 MPG. Handling is precise, sporty, and steering balanced and neutral, leaning slightly toward oversteer. With over 6 months of ice and snow, I have been amazed with the sure-footed habits of the Civic. My wife also loves driving it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Having driven the Civic through one brutal Fairbanks winter down to 50 below, the heater has proven to be excellent. Even idling and around town. Instrumentation is cool, and the ergonomics also very good. Looks very sporty. Very high resale according to most sources. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car after my wife objected to the look of the Prius. She was right. This car is much more stylish and given my driving habits, almost as efficient as the Prius. The car has been rock-solid with the only hiccup being a modification to the rear suspension to avoid tire cupping. You learn to drive a hybrid. The car has several feedback indicators which allow you to adjust your driving habits to attain the best mileage. During the Phoenix summer my mileage will drop to about 42 mpg (as measured at the pump), versus a best of 53 in the winter. The best feeling is when you are in "auto stop", look around, and realize that you are the only car not putting anything out the tailpipe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've owned many domestic vehicles and decided to step-up to the 'superior' quality of a Honda. What a disappointment! The first year was okay with the vehicle however it's now falling apart. Performs poorly in the cold, if it starts at all. Don't think of driving in winter weather without snow tires. The alarm is toast. The electronics are on the fritz. Seat belts don't retract. Weather stripping is worn through. Loud clunk in the trunk area when making turns. Has a severe shake when approaching highway speeds. Hard to find a comfortable driving position. Overall, the most disappointing vehicle we've ever owned! Will never buy a Honda again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have previously owned 2000 and 2004 Civic EX coupes and have loved them. My 2008 is a total letdown. It has the loudest, roughest ride of any car I have owned, including older Corvettes. The road noise is terrible. The entire car has been cheaply made. It seems loaded with plastic. Corners have been cut everywhere. It looks great from the outside, but that's the only positive about this car. The seats are too hard. The trunk requires forced slamming while the gas pedal has no tactile feedback. The sun visors are very stiff to use. The seat belt and directional noise chimes are much louder than my 2004. Actually irritating.

Quick throw 6 spd shifter is a blast. I wanted a car that had good looks, good performance, and good quality. This car has it all. I will be driving this car for many years to come</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to say I really do enjoy driving this car. Regardless of how slow it is, the feeling is very solid and really lets you feel the road. Brakes are a little weak (Civics have always had pretty weak brakes). Very small trunk space, but manageable. If you live in a very cold area (i.e. single digits and below), expect to see extremely low MPG numbers. I live in Chicago, and around town it averages about 30 MPG when it's 30-40 degrees, and when the weather drops to single digits and below, the mpg plummets to mid 20s. Highway isn't much better - when the engine is fully warmed up, cruise control on the highway at 65, I get about 35 MPG (again only in cold weather). Very disappointing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My ratings are based on comparing the Civic to other vehicles in its price range and this car really has the competition beat. Voice nav, play any digital media through aux, plenty of torque to get around LA traffic, no parking spot is too small and I get 28 mpg even though I'm always punching the gas. My previous car was a '98 BMW 540i with lots of power and surprisingly this car speeds up well considering its engine size. Combine all that with low maintenance costs ($40 for oil change, no prob) and a great warranty and this car leaves Nissan, Toyota and Mini in the dust.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2008 Honda Civic LX in Aug of 2008. 4000 miles later, I am still extremely satisfied with my purchase. When gas prices hit almost $4/gal in the summer of '08, fuel economy was a top priority. This Civic looks good, is fun to drive, and yes, does do well on gas. Fuel economy does depend on what kind of driving you are doing and how you drive, but I have been averaging around 35 mpg... but have gotten over 40mpg on more than one tank. I liked the look of the Civic and researched the car in depth, and found that used models were holding their value so well on the car lots that it made sense to buy a brand new model... my very first "new" car in fact.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm writing this review to call out one design problem with the Civic. On a long trip the front seats are downright painful. We took a 600 mile trip at Thanksgiving, my wife (5'6") drove down and I (6'1") drove back and we both developed a pain which lasted for about 24 hours afterward. We tried multiple driving positions but to no avail. It was bad enough that we'll never use that car on a long trip again. We got just under 35 miles to the gallon going 80 mph and fully loaded, which was great, but again - if I had purchased this car for a lot of long haul driving I'd already be looking for a replacement.

Had a modified 350hp awd car prior, and thought I was over the performance bug. Well, the Si is quick enough to satisfy your desires for speed, without giving you much more than that. It's now the cheapest of the viable sport compact offerings, yet yields the best MPG, and lowest sticker price. Handling is also great and significantly better than the ex. The ex was just as much better than the civic hybrid. I put on lightweight wheels and tires and got noticeable improvement in acceleration. City/Hwy MPG has been around 25/30.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great all-around commuter car. I have gotten 36.4 MPG calculated by my own consumption figures (not the built-in computer) for the first 11,000 miles. I drive 50% freeway and 50% very slow Los Angeles stop-n-go. The car is very comfortable for a small car and the ergonomics and controls are the best I have experienced. Fuel economy suffers significantly with a/c, slow traffic, and hills. Put any two of those together and MPG drops to the teens. This car cannot climb Baxter street in Echo Park, one of LA's steepest streets. It literally stops half way up the hill and will not move further even with full throttle. </TEXT>

This alone makes me dislike this car. The car has been in for service 3 times. American Honda Corp?s position on the problem is that it is within manufacturing standards. There is also a significant vibration in the steering wheel and roughness at highway speeds. The road noise is loud. This car does NOT get 34 mpg, 30 at best. I would not buy this car again.

Today it was -15C (5F) and the engine would not even turn over. I turned the key all the way to "start" - nothing. Engine would not even respond. I am very disappointed in this car.

However I don't think I will ever see those EPA numbers. The car rattles so much it is embarrassing - especially when cold, this car was not made for Canadian winters!

So, my heart was set on a Civic, but I wish I test drove the one I bought a little more. Overall, I still like it, but I've had it in the shop a couple times due to strong pulling to the right. It's better, but still seems very sensitive to the road. Neon went straight forever. Also, there's a slight throttle hesitation when you take off from an (almost) stop. Otherwise, drive is smooth, avg 35 mpg, now @ 2000 mi.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling. Smooth, quiet drive. Fit and finish much better than Neon. MPG is great. Hope that it lasts like a typical Honda is supposed to.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This Civic replaced my 04 Jetta wagon, which was a very nice car as far as amenities were concerned, but was otherwise a piece of junk. In the last two years I owned it, I had to pay $1000 each year just to pass inspection. Things broke that just shouldn't on a relatively new car. My new Civic is just like the '98 I had before the VW. It looks different, but is just as fun, just as reliable, just as economical. The new one is more powerful. I feel at home in this new Civic and plan on keeping it for a very long time. at 160,000 miles, I drove my old Civic 3000 miles cross country to sell to a friend, not a single problem. I expect this new one to be just as good, maybe better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth shifter, gas mileage, good looks, perfect ergonomics. BTW, I average 33-40 mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned a Honda, either a Civic or Accord since 1973. I purchased one of the first Honda Civics in the US (Wash DC). So I know the quality that Honda is capable of. This particular car I purchased over a Prius, based on the style and economy of the car. I can overlook the definite road noise that is present, but I cannot over look the low mileage, far below the est MPG of 40/50. The best I have gotten on a 180m trip was 30.8 mpg. As for city mpg, I average 28.7. Would I recommend this car, absolutely not. I currently have 420 miles on this vehicle (second car). She's not yet broken in, but looking at other's mpg- this car is really lacking. This will be my last Honda. Prius is right!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The style of the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am 6'2 185, fit in the car perfect no problem with leg or head room the seats hug you firmly which is nice. No sliding when turning or leaning. The dash is perfect placement and dims nicely at night when you turn on the lights. Got 45 miles to the gallon highway to Missouri from Connecticut doing 60 with a full trunk back seat and a passenger and is extremely quiet. AC perfect in 90 degree weather and the heat is fantastic now, a very insulated car, is still warm after an hour of sitting. Only complaint is the placement of the hand brake pressing against my knee, other than that the car is perfect..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bucket style seats hold you nicely, bold display, extremely soft clutch with smooth transmission timing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car for the money. Not sure why some people aren't getting good fuel economy. My driving is about 2/3 highway and 1/3 city, and my worst tank in 6 months of ownership has been 33.5 mpg. I average 34.5 - 35.0 mpg, with spirited driving. My best tank was 37 mpg while I tried to baby it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy, styling, high revving engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drive an 08 black Civic EX 5M. All in all this vehicle is very fun to drive. I love the shift, very easy compared to my previous manual vehicles. I seriously average between 34-38 mpg per fill up. No joke. I can get average 430-470 miles per tank and it's not even a hybrid. Mileage has a lot to do with owners driving. I have tons of fun on side streets with my car, but keep the highway driving around 60, and that shows about 40 mpg on the highway. With my crazy driving on side streets, it averages to 35 mpg usually. Great car for MPG!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design. I get a lot of compliments from friends and that's pretty awesome. Exterior is attractive in black. I'm looking to add a spoiler, so that should help. Very smooth ride.</FAVORITE>
