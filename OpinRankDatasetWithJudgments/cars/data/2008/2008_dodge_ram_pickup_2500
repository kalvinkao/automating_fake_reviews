<TEXT>I have had nothing but trouble with the fuel system I contacted Dodge and they know of the problems but refuse to fix them I was told I could watch a dvd if I had any questions the problem arose with the blue tech after I bought the truck (with all blue techs) to fix it you have to dive 45 min for 45 mph w/o going under 45 mph and under 2000 rpm every week this with give you the truck terrible mpg and wear and tear on the truck for no reason I tell everyone I know do not buy Dodge because if something goes wrong it's your fault for buying their product if you don't have the time to waste 1 1/2 hours a weeks for no reason at all buy a Ford or Chevy look into it for yourself call any Dodge dealer</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm back with the second installment... I still love this truck... Wanted to comment on check engine light issues, my dealer worked w/ Chrysler & Cummins and had a couple of fixes... the other thing I observed is even though I'm driving a 6.7l w/ 6A, shift it manually... also run with exhaust brake on at all times... I have know driven 20000+ miles w/ no engine light coming on... a little effort while driving & no issues... With a buddies truck, I demonstrated... Lug it - the check engine light comes on - don't lug, no issues... Keep the revs a little higher the exhaust brake on and it'll be as clean as a whistle... Keep on trucking...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The drive line is fantastic - fuel economy now that its broken in is approaching 23 mpg... </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I like the power of my Hemi. Turning is great compared to my old F250. Has 100 more horsepower and weighs 1000lbs less than the ford. The tire pressure light stay on unless you run 80LBS of air in the tires. Tows my 5th wheel with ease and with the long bed I have room for my across the bed tool box and still have room for my hitch. Plenty of room for turning the trailer when parking. With the HD option you have trouble lowering the rear end to the overloads. I haven't enjoyed driving a pickup as much in a long time. If you need a work truck for a decent price and fuel mileage it is a hard truck to beat. The only thing would change is go with upgraded interior and better paint.</TEXT>

I have owned over 40 new trucks..Dodge tells me I do not know how to drive one. This truck is a 2500HD 4 wheel drive Hemi. The worst truck I have ever owned. I am going back to Chevrolet.

<TEXT> I bought this truck, my 2500 dodge with the 6.7 in it on Feb 2008. It has been in the dealers shop 11 times now and is in there as we speak. I have turned it over to my lawyer with the lemon law and are waiting to see what the court is going to do with them going bankrupt. Truck runs great when I slam the fuel to it. But it jerkes all the time no matter what the speed. I just wish the dealers would get some real mechanics and not part changers. I am a Diesel Mechanic myself. The dealer has replaced the turbo and many, many sencers,they do not know what to do. Plus the factory does not help at all. Getting around 15-16 MPG. I did get 17 onces but I was going 45 MPH in Yellowstone Park!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a check engine the 2nd. week of purchase; and they haven't quit. I am now waiting for a new and improved turbo, jacob brake,what ever you call it, burned up the first one. Old turbo had been cleaned and reassembled, reset light, and regenerated, to only come back on again! I wish that I had my 05 5.9 back! I was told to drive with turbo on always until the new one comes in. I am pissed off about all of the trips to dealer. I was suckered into buying the "free" 3000 mile oil changes. Not anymore! They can shove their oil changes! Some mech. wallowed my cooling fins flat and to top it off I was 2(two)quarts over the full line! I am investigating the Lemon laws in Oregon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a Dodge Ram 2500 with 6.7l Cummins... Love the drive line... Front suspension issues - had to replace 4 ball joints & 2 front shocks at 18000 miles... mostly highway driving. (and I'm not plowing snow w/ this truck) While the rest of the truck seems bullit proof, I have concerns about the longevity of the front end on this 4 x 4 truck... </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6.7 Cummins is a big improvement over the 5.9 Cummins - torque & usable power curve are superior.

<TEXT>I bought this truck with a lot of of forethought. I have 50+ on this truck with only 1 significant problem (steering linkage) replaced and upgraded no problem. Yes the check engine light comes on when my wife drives it around town too much so I take it out on the highway and get on it ,no problems have come from it so far yes its annoying but the trucks positives outweigh it so far. Good mpg 18 all around. Did great 4x4 through death valley and 395 through a blizzard. Love the excellent brakes. Still have a good 50+ left on the front and more on the rear. I may not have as many problems with the soot in sensor issue due to the manual tranny which allows me to do the thinking not the computer .</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best truck I have ever owned. I have driven many many different trucks and I tell you without a shadow of a doubt this one takes the cake. It comes stock with an exhaust brake. It has plenty of room and more get up and go the it's earlier form the 5.9L. I was messing around with my cousin and we did a pull off with my truck vs his Ford and I drug him through the mud no problem. I love the best in class exterior design. no brick in the wind action like the Chevys. And the best of the best I can pull my 15,000lb trailer (even though it's not recomended) and still get 18mpg.</TEXT>

I have had it in 6 times because of 02 sensors sooting, turbo charger sooting, turbo replacement, 02 sensor replacement, replacement of map sensor, replacement of barometer sensor and now to top it off my truck smokes like a chimney at random.

<TEXT>I've had my new Ram for 1,200 miles and so far no problems. I've towed a tandem trailer with ease and the ride has been very acceptable. The seats are firm but comfortable. Love the storage behind the seats. The stereo sounds wonderful. I average 13.7mpg with trailer and 14.9 without. Lots of hills to traverse. The exhaust brake is fabulous. Run it all the time. So long as you get the truck out on the open road at freeway speed for 45 minutes periodically, the emission system will regen. It's a better and safer system than Ford or Chevy which uses diesel fuel to burn the particulates off. Their fuel mileage suffers for it. Look what happened to Ford and the famous flame out the tailpipe incident</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like most Dodge diesel owners this is my fourth diesel. I love the truck but I can see the emissions sensors are going to be a downfall. Mine never leaves home without pulling a trailer and it made it to 17,000 miles before the check engine light came on. The dealer said you can't just put around town with it and that I needed to work the truck. If 80 mph down the interstate with a 36' 3 axle trailer isn't working it I don't know what is. I have seen the Toyota prototype diesel and it looks good. If Dodge doesn't take care of its customers the customers won't take care of Dodge. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The new Cummins 6.7 L is a hoss. Mega power and torque. Emissions equip is a problem. What I have learned after 3 trips to dealer - don't lug the engine, keep the rpm in the 1,800-2,200 range (easy to do with the thumb shift on the stalk), don't let it idle for long periods (why would you want to with current diesel prices), if you putt around town, periodically take it out on hwy and run it hard, use the engine brake, even when not towing (this also helps save your brake pads), no problems since I made these adjustments, hope this helps. Previous post is accurate in that it drives like a 1/2 ton, nimble. On hwy at 65-70 mph - 22-24 mpg believe it or not, city 16, towing hwy 16, city 13.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned three (3) Dodge Cummins diesel trucks. Until the 2008, I never had a problem with them and worked them all hard. This 2008 with the EPA emissions is a total nightmare. The O2 sensor has been replaced and/or cleaned five (5) times and still corrodes up about every 1,200 miles. My attitude is "If it's not broken, don't fix it!". Why Dodge took a great performing vehicle and screwed it up is a mystery to me. Diesel's have always smoked a little and the environment has never been the worst for it. I'm sure there have been complaints that have driven the EPA to place restrictions on diesel emission, but come on America, don't we have more important things to fix? Leave trucks alone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought my dream truck, after 14 years of waiting. The truck was priced cheaper in dollar terms, than what it would have cost me to purchase in 1998, when I commissioned in the Army (30k v. 33k). Glad I got the 6.7, it has been great, so far (averaging 19 mpg, lots of HP and torque). A little bit less miles per gallon than the 5.9, but with a few upgrades (Royal Purple synthetic oil increased 1-2 mpg, and hoping Banks air kit increases another 2 mpg), hoping to catch the 5.9. Also, went with quad-cab SB, not mega, as turn radius and parking were so much better. Lots of power, and manual transmission and jake brake novelty haven't worn off (4000 miles on truck). </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this vehicle new, it is my 5th diesel. Just dropped it off third time dealing with engine hesitation. Finally got a straight answer from service tech. Stating that the 6.7 diesel has had major problems after 12,000 plus miles. Define major? Well my truck is having soot build up in the exhaust and to fix the problem it is costing Dodge $5000.00 to the factory, $10,000 to the end user if it wasn't under warranty. They don't idle well at all. In Dodge's rush to get this to the market they screwed up. I was reassured that it has a 100,000 mile warranty. Wow that makes me feel great I Wonder what the resale value will be on this once word gets out. What's lower than free?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned the truck for 2+ months so far and love it! Have the 6.7 L Cummins Turbo Diesel. With only 3500 miles so far I was getting 18-19 Hwy Mpg on a recent vacation trip. I expect to do much better once the engine is broken in. The exhaust brake is awesome and a big help when pulling a trailer in mountainous terrain. MegaCab provides roomy comfort for the entire family. Four Wheel drive in the sand at Cape Hatteras was no problem at all. I found that the slightly stiffer ride on the road really paid off when the wheels left the pavement. It handled the bumps off road with ease and gave excellent off road performance. btw - The stiffer ride goes away with a trailer or payload too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With 8 check engine lights and a diesel exhaust odor that comes from the vents with the AC/Heater on when the truck comes top a stop. A total of nine trips to the dealer for repairs. I would not advise any one to purchase a Dodge Ram with the new 6.7 Liter Cummins Engine. I now have to hire a lawyer(Lemon Law) to have this truck bought back because Chrysler will not work with me on a vehicle swap. Other than that its a good truck, fun to drive and built solid. But how Chrysler has treated me after owning 4 other Dodge trucks. I will be going to buy a GM truck after this one is bought back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I just got back from a 10 year anniversary trip to Kauai, Hawaii and were put into a 2008 Toyota Corolla rental car. First we were surprised by the fuel efficiency but when we returned home to our 2008 Dodge Ram hemi we realized that there was no comparison in the overall value. The comfort and utility was such a contrast to what we had rented that we both were very grateful we had made the right decision for our active family of four. Everywhere we drive we get nods of approval and our truck has gotten us safely through rugged Lake Tahoe winters and roads that the little Corolla couldn?t dream of. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This too is my 6th Dodge truck and second turbo diesel in last 15 years. I trade a perfectly good 2005 2500 Diesel 4WD truck for this one for one reason, THE SPACE IN THE BACK SEAT. And I haven't been disappointed in that area, megacab is awesome. But this is the only good thing about this truck. I have had nothing but problems with the "check engine" sensor going off constantly. I have put 18,000 miles on this truck in 6 months and in that time I have had it in service at least 12 times for the same thing. An O2 sensor had to be replaced before I ever took it off lot. I have also had numerous service calls on the tire inflation sensor. Could be great truck. Anyone else having this?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only 2500 miles on this truck so far, so things may change. Very quiet for a diesel, very powerful and turbo spools very quickly. Ride quality poor relative to competitors, still is pretty quiet. 6-Speed manual is not very smooth shifting, and takes a while to get used to. Interior design pretty good in my eyes, not a lot of wasted space and the rear fold-flat floor a great idea. So far fuel mileage is not great (14 mpg) but I've been pulling a light (4,000 lbs) trailer for half of the mileage. The Cummins engine is what sold me on this truck and I hope it proves to be a good decision. he Ford may be a worthy competitor though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently took delivery of my truck and am very pleased with the vehicle. I have took the truck on 2 snowmobiling trips towing a 2400lb trailer.I was towing in a horrible storm and the truck drove perfectly. I replaced my 2005 Nissan Titan with this vehicle and this truck is so much superior to what I had. Towing, power, comfort, reliability. The diesel engine is even quieter than the titan gas motor. The ride is suprisingly good for a 3/4 ton,due to the long wheelbase. The transmission shifts smoothly. So far it has been reliable with no factory defects. Time will tell. Much happier with this truck and think buy American is where it's at in Truckland. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just took delivery on a 2008 SLT 4X4 2500 with auto and 6.7L Diesel. What a truck! This vehicle handles like a 1/2 ton but the ride is a bit tighter. I went from a 2002 Toyota Tundra TRD 2WD access cab. I like the quad cab door arrangement as I always felt that the suicide style doors of the rear Tundra were worthless in parking lot when your right next to another car. This Dodge actually turns better (turning radius) than the Tundra but parking is still a slight challenge. The long bed or Mega cab with the longer wheel base would be much worse. The engine has power to spare and mileage on freeway at 65 is 21 - 22mpg with 100 miles on car...around town is not so good...12 - 15 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The diesel motor, UConnect -- works better than the Bluetooth in my 2007 Land Rover, ride and handling is excellent, solid build so far, transmission is also excellent.

Lots of get up and go with the trailer when I need it. Still getting used to the new interior design, trying to figure where to put things like sunglasses,storage under back seats is better than previous design.

<TEXT>My truck has a 6.7 liter Diesel, which is very thirsty. I get 11.5 - 13 mpg, even with the tailgate down. I hate to say it, but my '06 Hummer H2 does better than this! I did have a '99 Dodge 5.9 Cummins which averaged 18 mpg on each tank, long trips 21 - 24 mpg were normal. Besides economy, this thing has immense power, I have 35 inch tires on it and the torque abounds. I hope this tranny can handle the power better than the '99s. I will definitely upgrade to leather seats, the copilot complains there is no heat and limited adjustments on the right side. All the storage compartments are great & make good use of unused voids. Style beats Chevy & Ford. No problems with vibrations.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Must mention: I only have 1500 miles on it so far, so still a new truck. Exterior style, red is hot! 6.7 liter Cummins is potent and quiet(unlike my old '99). Much better use of space in cab. Dash is tidy, like the hidden cup holder tray.</FAVORITE>
