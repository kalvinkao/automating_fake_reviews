<TEXT>Bought our 2008 Elantra GLS sedan in early March 2009. I was a little disappointed with the high 20s MPG at first, but by the time the odometer reached 1000 miles, we were routinely getting 33mpg in 70/30 highway/city driving. 31-33 is what we routinely get in mixed driving recently. Overall, we really like this car. It has a good feel and is fun and easy to drive. We are closing in on 6,000 miles with no problems yet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had my Elantra for a year and have had zero problems. Very smooth ride, good acceleration, nice interior and have gotten compliments in parking lots. My 2008 replaced my 2003 Elantra, which also had zero problems. I bumped into the buyer Sept. '09 and they have had zero problems with the 2003, and have gotten nothing but brake pads and oil changes at 75,000 miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife had a Toyota corolla with 110.000 miles and I told her, its time to get rid of this garbage, we had problem with the corolla since we bough it, battery death less than a year, window motor broken after 3 years, so 3/36.000 warranty is not good. I check for two month the new corolla, matrix, yaris, civic, sentra, versa, etc, etc and I decided elantra se full loaded. I did a good choice, I feel so good driving this car, wow, the seats feel better than my kia sedona, minivan. The instrument lights are beautiful. I know its not perfect, but with so many stupid expensive cars out there that just take our money, elantra is perfect choice. I'm very, very happy, I almost forget, has leather seat,</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first car. Throughout my search I test drove many different cars such as the civic, corolla,etc. but found for the money, the elantra was def the way to go. Now having driven this car for a year I am completely happy with my decision. I am in college and do high mileage. Amazing on fuel, smooth ride, can be a little loud but def not that big of a concern. I am a tall person and this car fits me perfect. Very spacious. I would def recommend this car to anyone looking for a sedan with all the best qualities in one low price compared. Especially with the amazing warranties that Hyundai offers you would be absolutely crazy to go anywhere else.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the handling on this car. Throughout the year I have experienced a few scary situations and the car has done a wonderful job. I also love the spacious. Not only does the driver feel it but the passengers too. The trunk is huge! The blue lighting is soothing. Overall the car is just amazing:]</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this car from Hertz Car Sales for $9995+tax. We researched cars for several months prior to our purchase and were leaning towards the Elantra. When we saw this price, we went and drove the car. Wow! We were pleasantly surprised. It had under 25000 miles. So far we have had no problems. We love the handling, and at 70 mph on the freeway it hugs the road. Loaded with extras. It has a nice sporty feel. Consider this one if you are looking for a compact. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Over all I enjoy my car. It's great on gas, smooth ride, great pick up,roomy, I get lots of compliments. I enjoy all the features,especially for the price. It's not a car that's good for driving up steep hills, especially in snow or icy weather conditions,it's just down right scary. I was surprised at how easily the interior gets scratched up as well as the outside paint job.I have scratches galore from other people's car doors, people walking by ect. Oh yes, apparently someone at the factory forgot to put a screw in my rear passenger window, it came loose. The dealership fixed it at no charge. Otherwise the car is ok & I'm still happy I bought it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car defrost quickly & easily.I love the fact that my side view mirrors have a defroster, a must in New England. The interior features have everything you would find in other more expensive cars it just lacks a little durability/quality. Not a luxury car but get quite a bit for your money.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The windows on my Elantra are not tinted enough and the care get extrememly hot - enough to heat a meal if left on dashboard and I have a wheel cover on the steering wheel so I can touch it. I live in the south and it gets very hot. On long trips I have to keep something over my knees if it is in the summer and I have on short pants. The AC is somewhat inadequate unless run on high. Contacted Hyuandi America and they claim it is a problem for the dealership. So much for customer satisfaction. Will not purchase another one</TEXT>

<TEXT>First week of ownership 240 mi odo week stranded in 100 dregree heat as fuel pump went. Gas mileage citi/hw 20-24mpg - very poor and I drive conservatively. Fog lights and back-up lights provide no added vision - too small. Lot's of manufacturing defects, needs alignment, lights pointed down, steering column rubs and makes noise. Too bad as I would have bought 2 more and my neighbors also but not now after this disappointing experience. I recommend you buy Toyota or Honda - both of which I've owned w/o ever seeing the dealer in the warrant period - and the Toyota was the first year model (Tracel 1990) Now have 800 miles on vehicle and still not improvement in gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2003 Ford Windstar that was getting around 17 miles a gallon for this car. I still like approaching it in a parking lot and still think it is pretty cute. I got a 5 speed because I had one as a kid and was going through a mid-life thing! The gas mileage is a steady 29-31 depending where I drive. I still really like it overall. My husband keeps asking me if I still like it and it has been 8 months. I am not sure when he thinks I will say no. But I hope never!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first new car I've ever bought;I was car shopping for over a year prior. I test drove Civics and Corollas (in my price range) for about two months and something wasn't grabbing me. As soon as I test drove the Elantra, I knew that was my car. The interior is really good looking (get so many compliments, especially at night with the blue lights). I also love all the features (esp. the XM and radio controls on the steering wheel) and the drive is very smooth and secure. The car turns well and I love driving on the highway (quiet, good pickup). NOTE: I got a spoiler and it makes it that much cuter!</TEXT>

Its very comfortable. I've made 2 trips to MS so I have almost 13,000 miles on it and still loving it. Its a great car and would recommend it. Yes some can get lemons in any make/model but don't let one lemon spoil your awesome driving experience.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I first posted a review, in April. I had the car for one month and liked it. Now after taking three trips and putting on 5100 miles in three months, I can not describe how awesome this car is. On the trips I avg 35 mpg (mostly hwy). Normal everyday mixed driving avg has been 30 mpg's. Driving for long periods have been comfortable and enjoyable. During heavy rain, the stability control worked well. The heated seats warmed up quick, the stereo & XM have great a sound. The Electric Steering make parallel parking easy. One slight thing I noticed is the air conditioning seems a bit weak compared to my previous Elantra's (not bad, but did notice a change - may be due to the cabin being larger).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great Stereo w/XM & steering wheel controls -- Blue instrument lighting is awesome -- Steering wheel feels so precise and steady -- All controls are easy to use and feel/look great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>June 12, 2008Admittedly, when I went to another county to visit Atlantic Hyundai with gas priced the way it is, I was looking for an economy car to help me beat whatever is ailing us today. A lower payment and better terms were my objective, however crass and vehicle ignorance this may appear to suggest. What I found was a most welcomed and  impressive sales organization and in the case of the vehicle I brought home; the 2008 Hyundai Elantra GLS with the power package intact, the most outstanding vehicle I have personally owned and I was born when Harry Truman was a feisty "show me" President. The Elantra feels the road, has astounding pickup and get go and more. I also saved.-Jay Adler</TEXT>

<TEXT>I must admit I wasn't at all excited about getting this car. I had to lower my payments quickly due to some financial changes. I looked at the Mazda 3 & the Honda Civic. I just couldn't get a better price for the features that I got. My car is loaded with everything including leather. I'm very impressed with the fuel economy & I already have over 6k miles on my car. Rear seat passengers are always impressed with the leg room that a car this small offers. I am very happy with my decision and recommend this car to anyone in the market for an upscale economy car. it can't be beat for the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my car! Most bang for your buck!! I shopped around quite a bit before buying. I really had to think of my priorities, especially with a mortgage resetting in 2 year. Even without a "mortgage budget," I'd still pick either this car or the Sonata. I love the standard features. My bf was really pushing me towards Toyota or Honda until I showed him the price breakdowns including taxes, license, and interest expense. It adds up! Also, I was able to get the dealer financing promo of 1.9% for four years. I love the blue control lights!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I've been getting 29-30 MPG. Even my bf, who has a heavy foot, gets around 26-27 MPG. Keep in mind, this is mixed driving - HWY and local streets. Oh and the warranty!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought our Elantra two weeks ago and have really enjoyed it very much. We were basically looking for a gas efficient vehicle that made better mileage than our PT Cruiser. We must say that it certainly does that and then some with 28 mpg in the city and over 35 mpg on the highway! And that is with the air conditioner going all the time. Our mileage has almost doubled from our Cruiser and you can't beat the 5 year/60,000 mile bumper-to- bumper warranty. You don't get that with Honda, Toyota, GM or Ford! The relatively low cost of the car was a big factor also. We looked at how much everything cost and how much gas savings we would realize. We are very happy with the overall features.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety airbags all around; comfortable front seats for a big guy like me; XM radio, ABS 4-wheel disc brakes; good suspension and good handling; great car for the price; good value; big trunk; cruise control on wheel; great mileage; very good quality; great warranty; smooth-shifting automatic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had this car for a few days now, but I've been a long time Hyundai Elantra owner. Coming of a 2004 Elantra, I am very pleased with the upgrades to the current model. The ride is a lot quieter than it's predecessor and the interior design is definitely desirable. I am 6'2" 215lbs, and I fit very comfortably in the driver's seat. The upgrades stereo with XM and and AUX input makes this car a great boom box on wheels. Gas mileage is key with the rising prices at the pump, and I am seeing 28-29 mpg in and around town. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The newly designed interior provides ample space for a full grown adult in 4 or the 5 seats. Added interior creature comforts also make any ride enjoyable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the PZEV SE w/ Premium Package (Sunroof and Heated Seats) in Blue. The car was pretty difficult to find - there were only about 12 in the entire state of California. I personally think the exterior is quite stylish, much better than the civic or pre-2009 corolla models. Main gripes are that acceleration in PZEV is a bit poor (132hp instead of 138), and that gas mileage is not as good as corolla or civic (I get about 30 mpg highway, 22 or so city). Still, amazing value for money. I purchased for $16.8K all in, including California Taxes, Title & Registration (which are about $1600). I think (and hope) that this is pretty competitive deal considering the sunroof and heated seats.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The SE offers great standard features, including ABS, Stability Control, Side Airbags, XM Radio, Leather Steering Wheel, iPod jack, Fog Lights, etc. Sunroof & Heated Seats are great additions with the premium package. Blue backlights and rear armrest/cupholders are nice additions. Great warranty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The rebate caught my attention, I wanted to upgrade from my 2001 Hyundai Accent, and this was a perfect find! I love the exterior (black) and the two-tone interior. Excellent features for a ridiculously low price - sunroof, cruise control, XM radio, fog lights. It it very spacious, and driving it feels so comfortable. Wishing for lumbar support, though. You can't beat the warranty, and the extra features, and the gas mileage, and the sleekness, and the value...and I could go on! I've driven 350 miles since I bought it and I haven't filled the gas tank yet!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in the market for a small to mid-size car that gets good gas mileage. After driving the Civic, the Corolla, and the Mazda 3, I bought the new Elantra SE. It had more torque (read "get up and go!"). more room, and was more comfortable than either the Civic or Corolla, and was thousands less than a Mazda 3 with the same equipment. It's quiet and comfortable with lots of storage space.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At 814 miles, 17th day of ownership, the fuel pump went out and left me stranded. Hyundai's roadside said they would tow me to closest dealership and leave me there even though it was closed and would be for the next 2 days. On 21st day of ownership the drivers rear window wouldn't work and had to be repaired. The car didn't even have tags yet and is already falling apart. This particular car is a lemon and neither the manufacturer or dealership wants the responsibility for it, so as of now I'm stuck with an unreliable poor quality vehicle still searching for some help. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought his car yesterday and I am really excited about the purchase. I did a lot of research and after considering used and other makes, I settled on the Consumer Reports #1 small sedan. Car looks great (ie it looks expensive and is a big "small" sedan). Drives great and the power package is a great value. I'm graduating from college on Monday and this car looks young but not too young (like a Fit or Versa) so I'll be able to feel like a grown up in it :) Purchase price was 14,200+ TTL. I considered the college grad program ($13,500; 8.9% apr, 60 months, no money down, 45 days to first payment, etc.) but I got a lower apr through a bank. Shop around for best financing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Armrest-I test drove Versa and it didn't have one. Feels really spacious on the inside. Quiet ride and not bumpy in the back seat. Fold flat rear seats. Clear controls and blue lights at night. Lots of storage. Comfy seats.</FAVORITE>

But since I've had my Elantra, I've even driven just to the mailbox down the street! Sounds crazy, I know but I'll find any reason just to get in my car and go for a ride! It rides a lot smoother than I thought it would and I love the dash design and the blue backlights especially at night. Unlike other economy cars, the Elantra looks far from cheap and looks just as good parked next to an Accord, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>First noticed this gem as the top car in it's class as reviewed by Consumer Reports for 2008. I tested the usual crew, Corolla, Civic, Mazda3. All were real nice. When I tested the SE, I was impressed. I made a good deal and got the rebate on top of it. Had to wait two weeks for an SE in Carbon Grey with the heated seats + sunroof but it worth it. I actually got a compliment on it's color. First time in 30 years anyone even noticed the color of my car. Almost too zippy at freeway speeds. It's got the power when you need it. Yes, the engine is a little noisy when pushed. I like to think it sounds sporty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 6'6", 350 pounds and have been looking for a small car that I fit in for quite some time. I have found it with the Elantra. I have a 2004 Town Car and a 2007 Tundra which have plenty of room but not that great mileage for an everyday driver. I can actually exit the Elantra easier than I can the Lincoln as it has more head room. The interior is a little narrower and the leg room a little less but I am larger than most and I figure I have to give up something for that 34 mpg. The car is very impressive. The mileage on a trip was 34.5 and in all town driving in the 29 range. The acceleration is good and plenty of power for the MO hills. I would recommend the SE to anyone. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good interior room for a small car. Fuel economy. Engine power and response. Well built with no squeaks or rattles. Drives very easily with good steering response. Easy to maneuver in traffic and parking. Lots of standard features with the SE. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Researched Toyota (former car an 08 Corolla LE), Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra Se on the web and Consumer Reports. Bought the Elantra Se and am so in love with this car - something I could not say about my 08 Corolla. The latter was a nice car but nothing about it said luxury. (It was totaled by another driver this month) Am so glad I made the switch. Safety features were primary to me after the accident my Corolla was in that nearly killed 3 people. The 4 disc brakes plus Electronic Stability Control and side and curtain air bags sold me. I had wanted them on the Corolla but they were not available unless I went to another much more expensive model Toyota. Am blown away by this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lots of leg room and comfy seats. My passengers enjoyed riding in my Elantra and said it is pretty. It's sporty and has all the bells and whistles I wanted. I'm not sure if I'm getting good gas mileage because I'm still learning when to shift between the D and D3 gears. Otherwise, it's a smooth ride and strangers give me compliments on it all the time. The headlights are nice and bright, the mirrors get good visibility and the blue lighted dashboard is a great feature. The trunk opener on the remote is a good thing to have also. I feel like a queen when I drive it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the sound quality of the speakers. Mine has XM satellite radio and I use my mp3 player all the time. The music is the reason why I hate to get out of my car. I loved my Toyota Camry's 6 speakers, but the Hyundai's 6 speakers sound much better. They rock!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Didn't have to do much research on the Hyundai vehicle b/c this is my 3rd Hyundai in 6 years. Due to the rise in gas I was determined to get a car with an overall gas mileage in the 30's. Narrowed my choices to the Elantra, the Corolla, and the Honda Fit. The Fit seemed like a cute car, decent enough ride, but not good enough for the amount of driving that I do. I couldn't tell any difference btwn the Corrolla and the Elantra as far as the overall drive and quality. However, I got the Elantra for 3,000 dollars cheaper. The car drives very good, am surprised at the power and the cruising speeds. My wife drove it and I was constantly telling her to slow down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Edmunds and Consumer Reports cover all the great things about this car. We test drove late model Corollas, Civics, etc.-rebates on the Hyundais were too enticing. Though I liked the Sonata's ride, I found the smaller Elantra handled better yet still felt roomy. It's well-appointed with touches that feel like a much more expensive car including the premium audio w/XM. I like the solid sporty feel of the Civic, but as I've gotten older, I appreciate the higher entry position and comfortable ride of the Elantra (more like American sedans). The SE handled and rode noticably better than the GLS and the better fuel economy was a major deciding factor over the Sonata even with the smaller rebate.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety features. Gas mileage 27 to 28 mpg overall and 35 mpg highway. Very good acceleration. Telescopic steering wheel - easy to find comfortable position. Well-designed dash layout w/soft-feel padded controls. Premium audio system with XM Satellite radio and MP3 audio input. 16" Alloy wheels.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted an SE but Hyundai did not seem to have any. Went with the GLS and have not been disappointed. Have driven in the desperate rush hour traffic here in North Texas and was well pleased with the car's handling. On the road car did quite well, passing ok, wind noise ok, gas mileage both city and country very good. Quality of assembly, superb! Like the XM Radio.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have only had a little over a week. Love the way it drives and looks. Paid $14,990 with sunroof package. Only complaint is the alarm system goes off for no reason quite often. Brought to dealership & was told it's fixed, but when we arrived to pick up the car, alarm was going off in parking lot. Made another appt to bring back. Had to have the brakes looked at as it was vibrating when braking. This they easily fixed by shaving the rust that had built up sitting on lot. Brakes are fine now. Warranty is outstanding! Looking to sell my SUV & get another one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This title is an apt description of the Elantra I purchased in the middle of April, 2008. It looks even better in person, as I discovered at the dealership. I owned a 2002 Sonata GLS with the V6, but the test drive with this Elantra sold me. The carbon gray color looks excellent on this vehicle, and it has subtle, yet classy pinstriping on the sides. There are trim moldings on the doors and wheel wells which give it a finished appearance. Above all, it is comfortable to drive, with plenty of head room. The trunk (with cargo net) is spacious and useful. The ride on the open road is quiet and smooth. The 4 cylinder performs well. Quite nimble. Loaded with great features - even XM radio</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everything I wanted on a car came as standard features on the SE model. All four wheels have ABS disk brakes.

I have 3 kids and they actually fit comfortably in the back seat. Before I bought this car I test drove an 07 Pontiac G6 and an 07 Chevy Malibu, both were nice but neither compare to the Elantra. When I test drove this car I fell in love with it. It is easy and fun to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Elantra and it is by far the best. It is loaded with features and it has been turning heads wherever I go. That's pretty cool when you turn heads in a car that cost less than 20K. The only option I did not get was leather, but the cloth seats warm up quickly on these cool northeast mornings. Next week I am taking it on a trip and I can't wait to see how comfortable it is on the long trip. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Make no mistake, this is not a 32,000 dollar car, though Quality for cost is superb. Between 16,000 and 18,000 you will not find a better quality means of transportation. The Elantra is fun to drive with a great popular package features. The warranty on the car matches and or beats other motor companies. Surprisingly roomy interior, I am 6'2 and sit comfortable inside the vehicle. Fuel mileage is at 35 mpg with 65% highway driving. Exterior to interior noise control is that of a 26,000 to 32,000 dollar sedan. Purchasing this vehicle was not on the spur of the moment, Four months of going to one dealer to the next. Finally the right car for our family at the right price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My initial criteria for buying a new car was it had to have fuel efficiency of at least 35 MPG, have 4 doors, and be comfortable for me to drive. I narrowed my search to 3 vehicles, 3 different manufacturers. Surprisingly, the Elantra wasn't one of them but I decided to look at it after ruling out the Accent (only because of comfortability). I'm not disappointed and very happy that I did indeed look at and test drive the Elantra. What a great car for a great price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Elantra is a nice car with a great interior and decent performance. I was surprised to find out the engine uses a timing belt whereas the competition from Toyota, Honda, Mazda, gm, ford, chrysler have graduated to timing chains that never require replacement. Worse than that, the engine is a "interference design", meaning that if the timing belt ever breaks, the valves will crash into the pistons and destroy the engine. Interference designed engines were phased out by most manufacturers in the 1990's. A broken belt leading to engine destruction is a gamble that we dont have to take in 2008. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After reading numerous reviews of this car I thought I'd give it a look. I had just driven a fit when I walked next door to the Hyundai dealer and drove the elantra. I was very impressed. Feature content was unmatched, very comfortable (I am 6,2"), and visibility is excellent. Power is ok and mpg's are excellent. The most pleasant surprise to me was at 80 mph on the interstate it is really quiet. Nice build quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I saw the car, and for $14,305, I thought about it before buying. I looked at the Lancer, Civic, Corolla, Sentra, Spectra, Focus, Cobalt, VW Rabbit, and the Mini Cooper. The Hyundai just seemed to be the best deal on a new car. I took it on a long test drive, and determined I had found the right one. Two days afterwards, I knew I had made a mistake. The seat doesn't line up with the pedals, the pedals are lined up terribly, and the seat is terribly uncomfortable. The pedals themselves are lined up terribly, with a gas pedal close to the seat, and the clutch having a long throw. Excellent value in a car unless you are over six feet tall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven the Elantra SE Auto 500 miles since purchase two weeks ago. Steering on my unit is responsive and well-balanced, yet several units I test-drove had what felt like over-responsiveness to steering wheel movement. City ride is comfortable; minor bumps feel like minor bumps. Highway ride is comfortable too; easy to hit 70mph without feeling any loss of control. No difference in performance between wet and dry roads. Acceleration is adequate for ordinary highway merge, but is definitely geared towards fuel economy rather than fun. However, I did need to gun it once, and boy did it respond. Braking is smooth, although I have not needed to stop short. Avg. 29.9mpg in 50/50.</TEXT>

<TEXT>To be completely honest this was NOT the car I wanted. I wanted the new Scion XB. The price was the decider here and had to stay in budget. The car gives so much value for the money. My husband has a 2005 and while neither car has a lot going on in the power department it is definitely better than anything in its price range as far as features goes. I was less than thrilled to drive it off the lot but as time goes by I am really starting to appreciate the car. It turns heads at times which is a surprise and the biggest comment I get is THATS A HYUNDAI! The interior is very stylish and does not feel cheap.

<TEXT>This was to replace my wife's 3.4 V6 Alero. We looked around for the last 6 months,& chose the Elantra. Civics are far too expensive, even taking in to account their high residuals. We chose the Elantra SE over the GLS with preferred package, as for around $1000 in our case, we got the tremendous Stability Control, which Consumer Reports magazine say is the most significant safety feature on cars since the seat belt. See Hyundai web site for details of this & other SE features. The room inside is amazing, the ergonomics are superb. Little things, like doors opening a full 90 degrees to make entry/exit easier. A great little car. Try it & be amazed. Go for the SE though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am incredibly happy with my purchase. I had test driven the '09 Corolla, Dodge Caliber, Mitsubishi Lancer, Kia Spectra, etc. The only car that I liked more was the '09 Corolla (the '08 is horrendous to me) as it handled better and was a more comfortable ride. However, the Elantra offers many of the exact same features and includes a warranty that on the Corolla you have to purchase in addition to your vehicle to even come close. The Elantra does lack power on uphill climbs, but it cruises everywhere else. I'm getting about 33-35mpg mainly highway, about 28-29 city since buying it (have filled up twice). After the special financing, bought the car for $10K LESS than the Corolla!</TEXT>

<TEXT>One thing that is overlooked is that the Hyundai actually has a stiffer frame than Toyota or Honda, and you can feel it. The quality is just there. Absolutely superb. Very smooth on freeway, tight suspension rides nice although it's body roll in corners could be less. It's been said before that it looks like a baby Lexus or something, and in my silver color with tinted windows it does. I actually get a few looks. Rims are sharp looking. Absolutely perfect size car. Far from big, easy to drive yet amazing interior room. Transmission is a little on the "grandma" end of the performance scale but shifts and transitions smoothly. Trunk has releases to fold rear seats right near the trunk opening.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car after test driving multiple Toyota Corollas and a couple Honda Civics. The Hyundai is typically a couple grand cheaper and you get more bang for the buck. The gas mileage is decent but not great -- I think Toyota and Honda may have this car beat. I average about 23-24 MPG with mixed city and highway driving, though I do drive fast on the highway. The car is very comfortable and roomy. It feels like a midsize rather than a compact. The interior is very classy. The Elantra simply looks a lot better on the inside than the Corolla, which looked cheap and out of date. There is plenty of room in the backseat for passengers and the trunk is a good size. Overall ride is smooth.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior -- the blue lighting is a nice touch and the seats are very comfortable and don't feel cheap. Size -- Plenty of room for a "compact" sedan. Warranty -- Speaks for itself. Though the full warranty is only 6 years/60k (the 100k warranty is powertrain only), it's still a great deal.</FAVORITE>

We got the Popular package with the 08 Auto PZEV GLS and its everything anyone would need! Runs very smoothly, gas mileage is excellent, and it is very roomy. My parents can't believe how big the interior is! It has more rear seat room than our Subaru Outback! The trunk is also the largest in it's class and the rear seats fold with a trunk pass through.

<TEXT>I was convinced I was going to buy a Honda Civic but the Hyundai warranty and greater interior space hooked me. When I saw the standard features I could get for my money I was sold. My car has factory XM radio, alloy wheels, steering wheel controls for audio system and cruise. All of which I would have paid more for with the Honda. This is the first 4 cylinder car I've owned in years and the lowest price car I've had in a couple of decades. It fits the bill for me with the MPG and features.

<TEXT>First 200 miles: 34mpg mixed city+highway. As an 1998 Honda Civic owner, I was really impressed with Hyundai offers for the price. I wanted to buy another Honda, but I kept on seeing things that Hyundai was doing better at a lower price. Only BMW offered a better package+story in my opinion... but at a much higher price. -- I love the satel. radio. I don't want to leave my car now. -- I dealt with several dealers. Know your vehicle because the sales staff might not. "Trust and verify" -- The _relatively_ quiet ride and good acceleration is going to cause me to get a few speeding tickets. :-(

<TEXT>I researched sedans on Edmunds 3 years ago and compare all the foreign cars as well as domestic. Hyundai turned out to be the best deal hands down over ALL OTHER car makers. So I decided from that point forth to buy a Hyundai. I got a great deal from my dealership (below invoice per Edmunds). I have 27000 miles on this car. I haven't had any real problems with it (except for the recall). I have since upgraded this car with the factory keyless start system (its awesome). Great fuel economy. I started off getting 27-31mpg. Now I'm getting 35mpg. I've driven this car in treacherous snow conditions and she handled like a breeze. I'll probably update again at 50k miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>bought leftover '08. Paid $13,200. Has automatic, bluetooth, a/c, fog lights, xm radio, mp3, radio/cd. All for a measly $13,200 plus tax. Try buying a stripped civic with a manual and no a/c for that. Extremely comfortable and quiet once you are up to speed. Yeah it's a bit loud when you're accelerating hard, big deal. We had purchased a Kia optima lx and loved it. I actually like the smaller elantra better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I put 25k mile on my new Elantra since I purchased it 6 months ago. The best mpg was 35 and I usually get about 33 to 34 for combine city/high and I'm totally satisfied my car's mpg. The cabin is quite as 4cyl engine, the front dash design is cool and nice look, the sound system is awesome enough to listen clear and powerful sound from my favorite CD's. I never thought this is a small sedan because it provides a good room for even five adults. I went to Lake Tahoe twice with my friends and we all liked and impressed about the handling, acceleration, and the way breaking. It is worth for the money and some worry about resale value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The blue dash, 220watt sound system, visual, big trunk, ipod, 4 cup holders in front and 2 in rear, 6 air bags, extra console boxes, the sunroof, the extension sun visors, smooth transmission, buttons for trunk and gas opener, auto light beam control system.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Best Deal Going</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have always bought new vehicles and driven them between 250-300,000 miles. After exhaustive research which included talking to other Elantra owners I purchased one. I got a tremendous deal out the door including financing for about 15k(on an SE not GLS). On the last trip at 75 mph with the air on, a full load of passengers and full trunk I got 34 mpg. This wasn't based on the trip computer, it was the old fashioned way of calculating.Mixed driving 29 mpg. After 20,000 miles I am thoroughly convinced that this is the best deal out there. I test drove all the other cars in the class and sure some are peppier or handle better but if you are looking for best bang for you buck, here it is.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent gas mileage, the mileage computer on my car is very close to actual mileage. Driver comfort, I am 6'3 and it is plenty comfortable for me. Dash layout and driver controls are excellent. Reliability has been excellent. Standard radio very good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our little "Hunni" in December and absolutely love this car. It's quiet on the highway (very little "4-cylinder engine noise" - if you've owned a 4-cylinder you know what I mean), hugs the road, great turning radius, etc. It is the nicest "small car" we've owned or even driven to date (we're well into our 40's so have been around a few blocks!). We test drove this gem and both fell in love with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently just crashed my car into a tree head on. This cars air bags did not deploy. The insurance adjuster could not believe it. I was lucky that I was not hurt. This car has a huge crumple zone which is good I guess. I loved my car and I serviced this car every 3000 miles. Good car but I don't think the security of having 6 airs bags should make you feel safe. If I could include pics I would you would not believe the damage this car suffered in a 30 mph crash.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 10K miles I am really trying to like this car but my first year's ownership experience has been mediocre. One recall (fuel pump), two check engine lights (loose hoses), RR window track fell off and had to be repaired, Upholstery seems to be wearing poorly and it's light color shows dirt, dealership botched the first oil change (admittedly not Hyundai's fault) forgetting to replace the crush washer resulting in 3 qts of oil on my garage floor, interior door panels are cheap hard plastic and tend to scratch easily as well as rattle quite a bit. Otherwise car handles well is very ergonomic. My biggest disappointment are the latest iihs side impact test results...POOR/MARGINAL! Bummer... </TEXT>

<TEXT>I shopped Toyota, Scion, Honda and meant to test drive the Mazda 3. The deal I was presented with on my Hyundai caused me to stop shopping. I needed an economical sedan comfortable enough for a family of 4 safely travel. The room and drive was so pleasant, I probably would have been back after Mazda anyway. Engine noise I read about was not as bad as expected and the overall car is superior in functional design. After 6 months and 9,000 miles, I'm still finding new things about the car like the fact I can't lock the car with keys in the ignition. If the initial quality rolls into long term reliability, other car manufacturers will have to try extremely hard to win my business back. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a followup, I have had the car for 4 months and am very pleased with it. I have been getting anywhere from 35 - 38 mph in mixed driving. The brakes are excellent, the a/c cools the car down quickly and the heater warms it up just as quick. Again, I do not know why anyone would buy a Civic after owning this car. It is bigger, base models come with more, is much quicker, and costs anywhere from 2k to 4k less.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When the gas crunch hit, I decided to sell my Subaru (great car...bad city MPG) and purchase a small economy car. While focused on Civics and Corollas initially because of their stellar reputations, no dealers were willing to discount anything. So, I took my open mind to the local Hyundai store and drove the Elantra. I was immediately impressed with the car. Then I started to read up on it. Consumer Reports rated it HIGHER than the Civic and Corolla....as a matter of fact it rated it #1 in class. I bought an SE for $16,100....a full $2,200 bucks less than the best price I could get on a Civic EX. I have already put 12,000 carefree miles on it and would recommend it highly!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great fuel economy, most standard features in class BY FAR, interior room...especially in rear, seat comfort on long trips, good handling, ergonomics - everything is in the right place, standard XM, large trunk for a small car, nice (albeit not earthshaking)exterior design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a follow-up of my 1st review. I still love my Elantra and still think it is unbeatable for the $$. Those of you who complain about it should definitely consider spending more money and buy in another segment...Since I put brand new winter tires on, I don't get more than 27 MPG. Got free XM for 3 months then 4.99 $/month special; told them would cancel after and got another 3 months at 4.99/month...Bought the trunk tray and find it essential. Just experienced the ESC taking over on icy road and it did a TERRIFIC job!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Really Nice car for its price. Fuel economy in the city 23 mpg using it for pizza delivery around 100 miles a day. Suspension can be better. Also there is a little bit of cracking in the interior but can't complain since I got the car for only $14,200 (a lot of negotiating). This car is made for gas saving so don't expect any good acceleration for racing. A lot of room inside and trunk is huge. Looks a lot better with tinted Windows and make sure you get seat covers in they are not black. All my friends have been impressed. If I don't get any mechanical problems, I will recommend this car to everyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased an 2008 Elantra GLS with a 5 speed and the popular equip package for low $15k in July 2008. So far I LOVE it. Before this I was a strict 80s GM boat guy. This car is much quicker than I would have expected, and my MPG has been between 29-36mpg per tank. I am very happy, and I can't stress how much fun the car is to drive. The interior is more roomy than you would think from the outside and the back seat is more than sufficient. All around, I am very impressed with the quality of design in this car. I feel that Hyundai may be entering the realm that Toyota and Honda entered in the early 90's. Give it another few years and these cars will have the reputation they deserve!</TEXT>

<TEXT> After having the Elantra for 6 months, I'm a very happy Elantra owner. I have not found one defect inside or out. This car delivers up to 41 mpg on the freeway and as low as 27 city which is a huge range but with the AC off on short trips in a rural area I average 31mph. We also purchased a new Civic Ex about the same time for my wife.I have to say that the Elantra has a much smoother and more quiet ride than the Civic EX that my wife drives. The Elantra has a slower responsive steering set up but not sure if that is bad since I'm not racing the Indy 500. The interior could be nicer but for the money, this car is hard to beat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a reasonably priced car that is a good value for your money, stop here! The Elantra serves you well-smooth driving, stylish yet simple and functional exterior (clean lines) and interior (blue-lit dashboard, easy-to-use controls, roomy trunk)with plenty of leg & head room. Hyundai's warranty can't be beat! I have been very happy with the car and am glad I didn't shell out extra money for a Honda or Toyota. A word of warning: a few months after I bought the car I received a letter from Hyundai Corp. that the fuel pump was recalled. I had it replaced for free at the dealer without a hitch but I figured I'd spread the word. All in all, great car-I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive quite a bit and wanted a car with good MPG. Was looking at the Honda Civic and then the Consumer Reports review came out on the Elantra, peeking my curiosity. After renting an Elantra for a week, I decided to purchase one with leather and a sunroof. I could not find one anywhere close to where I live, all the dealers laughed at me for trying to find one. I finally located one 500 miles away with everything I wanted and drove it home. I am extremely satisfied with it, gets almost 36 MPG highway and about 30 locally. It has plenty of pep and is responsive, the sound system is excellent, the car is quiet inside and has plenty of room upfront. This car is a bargain. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Truly amazing how much car you get for the dollar. Pzero, fuel economy, fun to drive and less of an economy feel than expected. Hyundai certainly has come a long way. Thank goodness the hybrids at the time were too in demand and their dealers were so high and mighty. We started to look most fuel efficient and then cost efficient and ended up at a Hyundai dealer. After checking consumer comments here, the price and the test drive, there was nothing left but to do the smart thing and buy. The sparkles in the paint help it look clean even when it's not - bonus for the lazy owner. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had this car for about 5 months and we are very pleased. It has zippy performance and gets 27MPG City and 35 MPG Hwy in the process. Braking is excellent. The four wheel discs do make a difference. The sound system with the XM radio, while not world class, is very pleasant to listen to. In town, it handles beautifully. At speed, there is a bit of extra body roll (especially right turns for whatever reason). I would recommend the 5 spd M. It makes for much more driving fun. The shifter does great as long as you don't force it. This car is extremely comfortable under pretty much all conditions (front and back). There are a lot of things "well done" about this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the blue displays. Easy on the eyes. The seats are comfortable front and back. The car also has an extremely solid feel. No creaks or rattles. It has the look and feel of a car that costs thousands of dollars more. Best new car value on the road in my opinion. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I bought the Elantra, I thought I was downsizing from a Suzuki Grand Vitara, but the interior of the Elanta offers more hip, shoulder and leg room. The gas mileage I am getting is better than the EPA sticker, at 35 HWY. The first weekend I had the car I went to Mt. Rainier here in Washington. The car handled like a dream on tight curves and was never sluggish on the climb up. There was always lots of power for any steep grade. The car is comfortable, peppy, very fun to drive, solid, responsive and feels larger inside than my parents' Intrepid. My husband is 6'2", and even with some back problems, he has no problem getting in, and has lots of leg room. I absolutely love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our Hyundai Elantra around the middle of June. We already have over 5000 miles on it, and we have not had a single problem. We love almost everything about the car. It gets decent gas mileage-we are averaging 29 mpg city/highway combo. It has an excellent safety rating in Consumer Reports. It comes in some way cool colors. There is one issue we have: the back window is too small, so sometimes I'm nervous changing lanes, especially on the freeway. Anyway, it's a cute little car that does what it says it will do. In the Valley, you'll pay a little more-ours 14000 with no extras. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned many vehicles in my life. The range is from a Mustang to 3 Civics. This car is comparable to all of these in style, comfort, and performance. A side by side comparison of the Elantra and Civic will show very similar numbers on and off paper. I purchased my SE at the base model GLS price of 13,800. Buy consumer reports car buyers guide, that shows dealer prices, and you should get to that price too. I also purchased the extended 10 years 100,000 miles warranty for $1,200. I am not certain about the reliability of the "new" Hyundais, there was a drastic redesign introduced in 2004, but with this bumper to bumper 100,000 mile warranty I don't have to worry about anything.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This vehicle is very roomy. The fit and finish is nicer than a Civic. The car performs on par with a Civic. The standard options for this car are great. Namely the airbags that surround the entire roof of the vehicle. I also test drove an Accent, but didn't feel safe in either the 2 or 4 door.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I spent the past 2 months doing tons of research and drove salespeople crazy in test drive after test drive. I tested repeatedly the Mazda 3, Toyota Corolla, and the Honda Civic. I am glad I purchased the Hyundai, I get what I feel is much more comfortable ride, and it fits me perfectly, I'm 6'2''. It comes with the highest safety ratings compared to the other vehicles, and all the bells and whistles as the others and for thousands less. My first drive home netted me 35.7 mpg, better than any of the other cars. Very well pleased all around.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4 wheel disc brakes, XM, cruise, full power options, 6 airbags, good seating for tall guys like me. The Power Assist steering, that's pretty awesome. Gas mileage...I love it, nice tight and quiet ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just recently purchased the Elantra and the deciding factor was cost. I own a Civic and the Elantra is just as good, if not better. Plus it costs about $3k less. The car is really responsive and is great with gas mileage. I have been getting about 31 miles in mixed driving, mainly city. There are plenty of cup holders (Civic has just 2 - go figure that one out) and plenty of storage space. The trunk is very roomy. I do not think you can go wrong purchasing an Elantra.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Clutch is really easy to use, it is peppy, plenty of storage space and it even comes with an arm rest, unlike the Saturn Astra and Honda Fit. Standard ABS, 6 air bags, powerful a/c - the Civic is far behind the Elantra with their a/c. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Went from a large SUV to the Elantra based on a month of researching fuel- efficient vehicles. This one is living up to its hype. I'm saving $200 on gas monthly (was paying $100 a week with my SUV). I thought that downsizing to a car would be depressing actually (have been driving trucks/SUV's since 1995), but the Elantra is surprisingly great. It's loaded with features that you would pay extra for in other vehicles in the same class. Someone listed the front seat as needing lumbar support, but it feels fine to me. As far as room goes, I thought that would be a problem in this car. Man was I wrong! 5 people (plus baby seat) and all their luggage actually fit in the car. BUY THIS!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cruise, pwr wind/doors, remote door lock/alarm (not included with Corolla), and the 172 Watt XM Radio with 6 speakers. As far as safety goes, I think 10 airbags speaks for itself.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Finally went with the SE Elantra after test driving a Nissan Sentra and Mazda 3. The Sentra is ugly and looks like it was made out of legos and the Mazda 3 is not made for anyone over 5'9" (I am 6'0). The Hyundai was the best choice and I am VERY PLEASED. The car has good looks, the 2.0L rides smooth and has a great punch. The interior is nice looking and roomy. The free 3-month subscription to XM radio is also an added bonus and I can listen to the 80's hits station for the whole ride. I HIGHLY recommend this car, it is the best bang for the buck with the best warranty out there. Hyundai is definitely going places, Toyota and Honda should watch their backs!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased a 08' with the standard package (AC, Satellite radio, etc.) out the door cost was mid 14K. The car's engine is peppy and if when drive it conservatively we have averaged 30-31 MPG and this is ALL city driving. Could not be happier with the mileage. The car is the roomiest small car out there, we researched and test drove, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Kia, Mazda 3 and 6, Chevrolet Malibu. None of them matched the roominess of the interior or that of the trunk. I am 6' 1" and my son who is the same height can sit behind me in relative comfort. Two large golf bags fit easily in the trunk, something you CANNOT do in the civic. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The warranty is awesome 60K bumper to bumper, 100K on the drive-train, FREE roadside assistance anywhere in the US, including hotel rooms and meals if a repair requires you to stay over night.

I also love the satellite radio, auxiliary output, the nice blue lights, the good-sized trunk that easily fits all our baby stuff and more, and of course the safety features and awesome warranty.

<TEXT>The car is very fun to drive. Handling is Great. Braking and cornering are very confident. The car always has good grip on the road. The engine gets noisy (rev) around 3500 rpm but I think it's kinda sporty. Fit and finish is excellent despite a few negligible low-quality material, IMO, better than Corolla and Civic. Blue ambient lighting is very cool. Controls are well placed and ergonomic. Seats and headrests are comfortable. Steering wheel audio controls are convenient though I keep using the dial on the center; it's a habit. Regetta Blue looks awesome. I heard it's a rare color. The ride is very smooth and comfortable. Those multi-link suspensions on front and rear really helps a lot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the past several years I have been driving a Full size 1/2 Ton truck and moved to the Elantra because of the price of gas. Once I got past the idea of staring at truck lug nuts I have found this car to be very fun to drive and the ride is way better than my truck. Can't complain about the gas mileage either, I am getting 31 mpg on the highway and a little better than 26 mpg in the city. I can't even come close to the gas mileage in my truck.</TEXT>

I am so happy that I purchased this car, I got some much more for my dollar compare to the Honda or Nissan. I am 6'4" and I fit nicely in this vehicle and the ride is very smooth for being a moderately priced sedan. The other big savings was in my insurance because of all the safety features and ratings the Elantra received.

I have it in the carbon gray color and that helps so it doesn't look so dirty! haha The interior is a nice light gray color. A lot of compartments inside to store anything you could possibly need in a car. Lots of cup holders. Big trunk, it fit everything from my big trip walmart last night.

<TEXT>Mostly, I am very impressed with this car. I have owned 6 Hondas over the years...they were all great. This mfr has come a long way with their line and particularly with the Elantra. This car needs more "Get-up & Go"... and less (Mitsubishi) engine noise. I can and will live with these two minor flaws...just an annoyance. Best mileage to date: 37 mpg; the qualifier here is: did not exceed 70 mph & no air conditioning on. While the car has no trouble traveling 75/80, the mileage suffers. Watch the tack and keep it as close to 2500 rpm and you will see your best mileage, also use cruise control when possible. Still lov'n this car and hope it keeps on keeping on.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a 2007 Elantra GLS for the past year (actually my husband's car), I decided when my minivan lease came due this month I would buy another Hyundai Elantra GLS...Well, I did and I'm so glad. The 2008 Elantra has a slightly different driving feel. The steering wheel has a more sportier/sturdier feel. The controls are all well placed, and the well thought out compartments and bag holder would make any mom smile. Though from the outside the trunk appears small, it can fit my son's base drum and all it's parts when the two back seats fold down. It's a sharp little car with a big car feel. Grips the road and is great on turns.</TEXT>

The warranty was a deciding factor, along with the price with incentives, of course. The Elantra is very roomy and comparable in roominess to my Ford Explorer Ltd. V8. The MPG is a definite plus! I love to drive this car. It handles extremely well driving between cars, etc. There is no 'drag' as I found with other similar cars when I was test driving, the Honda Fit, for example. This was the most impressive, with the Nissan Sentra, a close second. This car beat the Sentra though in safety, warranty, and price, among others. Daughter will drive and want one for Mom, too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Elantra SE about 1,100 miles now. I was looking for a smaller, more fuel efficient car to replace my large SUV. Comparing many models in the mid-size sedan category, the Elantra always came out on top. I was particularly drawn to the SE model for the standard Electronic Stability Control. Safety in a smaller car was a big concern, having always driven a large van or SUV. The ESC answered that concern. The adjustment from driving a large SUV to the Elantra took no time at all. The seats are comfortable and it handles like a dream. Road noise is almost nonexistent. My 6ft+ husband and son both fit comfortably in the front and back seats. I have no regrets. I love my car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pros- I have yet to find any defective cosmetic/operational problem with this car.The ride is better and the road noise is much less than the new Honda EX Civic that my wife just purchased. Cons- Sluggish steering, around 30 mph the transmission should down shift to a lower gear but refuses to and you will get this engine strain noise & sometimes I manually down shift the transmission in city driving to get it out of its misery. Summary- This is the best value out there if you are keeping a car for a few years. You can't wrong considering the options you get for the money. I would not have purchased this car if I had intended on trading in a year or two as one would take a bath.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Price, gas mileage, standard safety options, and warranty are why I chose the Elantra over other cars in its class. I love all the standard options like XM, 4 wheel ABS, standard side airbags, heated mirrors, blue lights, fog lights, stereo system. I chose this over the Nissan Sentra because of all the standard equipment and the warranty. You just can't beat it. It's a fun car to drive, handles well and just has a overall sturdy feel. It sips gas and after driving a light pick up for over ten years the gas savings are noticeable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Elantra SE an excellent compact, reasonably roomy, smooth and quiet on the road. And it handles better than one first expects on windy roads. Among its peer group, it is more refined and understated than the others, and more comfortable. And, one can buy a fully "loaded model" for about the same price as very lean models from Japan. The satellite radio sounds very nice and is easy to use. On long trips, its very comfortable, which is unusual among cars in this class. We obtained much better gas mileage (40 ish) on the highway at 65-72 mph than EPA or CR reports, admittedly with a light foot. Its only weaknesses so far are its somewhat numb steering and a rather slow take off. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I suppose its best single feature is its front seat. The driver has an excellent view of the road and all controls. The seat is comfortable and (with leather) heated. </FAVORITE>

Pickup is good and gas mileage is in the high 20s on the first tank - sure to get even better with time.

The highest gas mileage ive gotten is 27.1 mpg on the freeway at 60 mph. Mine is the Gray colored one, the paint scratches easily, my thumb nail has worn a scrape in the hollow spot of the outer door handle.

Elantra drove almost as well as a new VW jetta & better than the civic or sentra. Pros-ride, handling, steering, grip, warranty, brakes, overall quality, mpg, price&rebate. Hyundai is now making good cars!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Front end and interior styling. Good quality interior material and feel, better than Civic! Good looking allow wheels with a good tire size. 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS,ESC. Multi-link rear suspension. </FAVORITE>
