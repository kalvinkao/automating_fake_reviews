<TEXT>this car was bought new sight unseen,What a mistake.Interior has little to no design.If you like plastic you will love the interior because other than the uncomfortable seats it is all plastic.Cup holders are non functional in the standard shift model.The back seats serve no purpose.exterior look is ok but needs some accents.Handling is not very good at higher speeds.Engine has some power but nowhere near as responsive as the older models.(2000 and older)The best way to describe the ride is to drive a dump truck with concrete wheels.Needless to say the 2008 mustang gt is not a good choice.Try the new chevy camaro,better looks and more speed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Always wanted a muscle car but got married young while my friends were driving Mustangs, Road Runners, and Corvettes. Now they are driving mini vans while I am cruising in my GT convertible. Started talking to my wife about getting a Mustang since the 05 hit the dealers, not really thinking that she would go along with it until one day she said "if we get one can it be a convertible", it was then that I knew she wanted it as much as I did. I hesitated about the convertible since I never had one and I remember the old rag tops leaking with lots of wind noise. I test drove one and found it to be pleasanty quiet with the interior of the roof very plush, hardly looking like a convertible.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I am so happy that I got the convertible. I ordered it so I could get it exactly as I wanted it in Vista Blue with the cloth top, 18" chrome wheels that come with GF Goodrich GForce 235 50 low profile tires. I also added the GT package to get the hood scoop and chrome tip exhaust. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this 2008 Bullitt in January 2009 at Ford employee pricing plus $2000 rebate. The exhaust note on this car is incredible- every time I start it I feel like an 8 year old who just stole the keys to the Batmobile. Edmund's review of this car lauds the shifter, they weren't kidding- incredibly smooth. Fantastic seats, great appearance. Fuel economy is poor in town given the low gearing but I've averaged 25+ at steady 75 mph on the highway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powertrain. Sleeper appearance. Folding rear seats passes the bicycle test w/ rear wheel removed (the new Camero doesn't).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My car has the shaker stereo, leather, etc. I was surprised that the Radial T/As it came with stunk - got rid of those tires and replaced them with some hot Falkens - now it handles GREAT. It is really just a two seater tho - don't really know why Ford had to design the rear seat with the back practically straight up but it makes sitting back there a painful experience if more than a couple blocks. The front seats are great - and LOTS of leg room. You can see the seams in some of the plastics which detracts from an otherwise well executed interior design. I bought the V6 thinking it would get better mileage - I shoulda got the 8 I think it mighta got better mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the Shaker 500 stereo - can't image what the 100 would be like! LOVE the drop top! And the fun to drive and run around in cannot be beat. The trunk space is surprising and so was the fact that the pass. seat won't completely recline - which is kinda weird. Nevertheless would buy another!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car does more than expected for the price. The 300 horses give a fun launch from a stop and provide pretty good high speed acceleration. Floor this car at 100mph and in seconds you are at speeds you shouldn't be doing - not that you should have been doing 100mph in the first place. But, the car performs well at high speed. What really impressed me was the ability to take corners with this car. This car eats turns for breakfast and you would have to spend a lot more money to equal the handling of this car. Now is the car comfortable hitting potholes? No, and it wasn't meant to be. So, if you want above average power and looks for a fairly low price this is a good choice. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 300 horses under the hood. Incredible handling. Good, retro looks. Engine that roars and backs it up. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Mustang GT is the musclecar buy of the last 40 years! It goes well, stops, idles, and cruises like a dream. It runs on 87 gas and gives all 300 Horses doing it. The car is when driven responsibly the safest sporting car in the U.S.A. The visibility is excellent, the exhaust note is hypnotic. The stock stereo has cheap made in China speakers that sound anywhere from ok to very very poor especially at volume. The a/c is iced cold anytime right away! The ergonomics and controls are sheer simplicity. The retro design of the interior with the satin aluminum package is a work of art. The plastics are thick and affixed very well. The surfaces may appear cheap but they are strong! Wow!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The air conditioning cabin air filter has helped my asthma and allergies. The gauges, controls, and switches are flawless, The engine, exhaust, brakes, and tranny are super heavy duty! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2008 Mustang V6 with Pony Package at the beginning of 2009 and I love it! You can't beat the beautiful styling for the dollar. Pony package adds a performance look with fog lamps and Bullitt wheels. GT handling package really makes cornering a BLAST! Mine also has the optional Shaker 500 audio system, which I HIGHLY recommend if you are a music fan. Fuel economy is OK, I would have expected better from a V6 but it's not all that bad. The enthusiast in me can't help but want just a little more when I press the gas pedal, but this car has PLENTY of pep for most people, and it sounds really cool when accelerating. If you want power I suggest paying the extra $ for a GT.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A great car! It is what it is a pony car with grunt,style and flair. I get positive comments from 10 to 80 year old guys and dolls. My Acura rarely gets attention like the Mustang! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power from the small block V8. Handles well for a solid rear axle..just don't over do it in the hard corners with bumps.Very good fuel economy. Sound of the engine/exhaust.Ride, seats, shaker 500 is good, build quality, paint, 18 inch polished wheels,easy to maintain, tires,are all very good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My main focus is to drive a car that doesn't make feel bad about the purchase price or the fuel economy. My V8 gives me 24.7/MPG combined city/highway. I have the power when I need it and the smooth ROAR to brag about it. I didn't pay through the nose like I would have with some other performance cars and the looks are great. It doesn't have the girlie bells and whistles, like my wife's car does, but I didn't have to pay for them either. It's athletic, handsome, inexpensive to maintain, and it's american made and proud of it. Don't just buy one, buy two for the price one foreign made! When you're old and cranky spend your money on a luxury expensive car that only an expensive mechanic can fix</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is precise and sharp. Power that makes you feel it's an exension of yourself. Love that window closing automatically for the last inch. Great 500 shaker stereo system. Rear fold down seats are very practical.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I imported my 2008 Black Mustang Convertible pony package from US to UAE (United Arab Emirates) being a sports car lover for years, it was my dream come true, but from the first day itself I was disappointed as far as comfy, quality and power are concerned. I thought Dodge Charger is more refined and comfortable, mustang behaved like my 1997 Ford Explorer though I thought Explorer is better in comfortability. But the moment I drop down the top it became totally different species all together. I became the center attraction, and it was fun to drive around in neighbor hood with loud music on. Better than my 1999 Camaro Convertible. All complaints are vanished! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Retro; unmistakable American Muscle Car look, nice interior design (not quality), leather seats, black carbon fiber dashboard look, convertible is a winner all the way.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased #4523 in 2/09 and I love this car. I have been in the market for a new car for 5 years and I test drove many cars like the 350Z, RX8, 370Z, EVO VIII, IX, and X, all of which are very nice cars and definitly worth considering. The Bullitt is suprisingly comfortable and head space is very generous. At 6'7", this something I need to consider. Ride is firm but not overly stiff. Nothing beats the power and torque curve of a V8. The other vehicles do not have that brute force, authoritative power that the Bullitt has. Also, all of the afore mentioned vehicles require 91 octane fuel and the Bullitt does not. Bottom line: This car is fun, fast, and relitively practical.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Understated retro styling make this a very attractive car. Comfortable seating and quality materials used for the interior. Let's not forget the powerplant and its wonderful exhaust note. The handling is great, especially for a car with a solid rear axle. The ability to run 87 or 91 octane fuel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First and last FORD I'll never buy a Ford again! I agree with everything the editor said in his review about the mustang, it's a really nice car for the first 5,000 miles or so. Check out the TSB service bulletins for the mustang before you buy one! Many problems, engine misfire, water leaks by the buckets from dashboard, auto tranny failures,can't fill gas tank,and Ford is the worst at fixing the problems. They give it the sunshine treatment for the expensive problems until your warranty is up. I have replaced the trans, a/c comp, alternator, 3-batteries, power steering pump, and more! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It would be a really cool car if Honda, or Toyota had built it. The All-American Sports car is 65% made in Mexico and China.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ford got the Bulllitt Mustang right in so many ways: I love the low-key, retro styling cues throughout. No stripes, no fins, no flames, and very little chrome. Slick shifter, engine pulls hard, and has a satisfying muscle car exhaust note. I owned an '86 GT and this thing handles like it's from another planet. You can actually throw it around curves without the rear end breaking loose at the slightest tap on the gas. Excellent seats and very comfortable on a couple of 300 mile road trips. I'd like another 200+ HP or so, as the car does run out of power before I'd like, but I couldn't afford the Shelby GT 500. I rarely get to drive it that hard, so it's a mild criticism.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bullitt package extras well worth it. Front seats are spot on for a 6'/200 lb. guy. Engine and shifter just beg you to drive it hard. My two kids fit in the back seats. Ipod jack in the console is nice. Sound great. Understated styling works for a 40 year old.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As far as comfortably priced and comfortably equip sports/muscle cars go this is the best I have ever driven. With leather and an appearance package tacked on to this little V6 you don't need much more. With 210 horsepower (I'd argue there was more) this V6 will kick any little 4 banger out there to the curb while not quite being dangerously powerful. If your looking for power and style with a reliable name and company look no further.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Responsive acceleration in any gear, air vent design (found myself playing with them at stop lights), and customizable gauge color. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is an absolute blast to drive. Who ever said American car companies don't build cars people want? I will line up any Toyota, Honda, Nissan, etc. against this baby. For the price it can't be beat. First off the torque is unbelievable. HP is immediately available. No need to wind this baby up. You won't want to play the excellent 500 watt Shaker stereo radio as the exhaust note is the best sound you will ever hear. I test drove 20 different cars but when I got in this one I knew I was going to have to purchase it. Very easy to have fun driving around town and you will get 17-24 mpg on 87 octane. Fill the tank with 91 octane and hold onto your seat. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite feature is the awesome torque and HP of this free breathing engine. The exhaust note is just right. Not to loud but powerful enough to say it means business.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you want a mean sounding, torque pounding, rumbling V8 with a 5 speed (like I did), with modern day comfort, the Mustang GT is it. Leather seats are comfortable. I installed 3.73 gears, lowered the car 1.5 inches with Ford racing springs and added the FRPP GTA axleback mufflers that come on the Bullitt Mustang. The car is set up the way it should be and with the mods, still under $26K. The GT is raw and the ride is a little on the rough side but it's so much fine to drive. Gas mileage for me is around 20 overall. If you want quiet and refined look elsewhere. If you want a solid fun RWD V8 at a great price with unlimited aftermarket support, get the GT. No regrets at all! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned a few Mustangs and typically leave the exterior plain and spend the time and effort on modifying the engine and suspension. My wife and I both saw a 2008 Bullitt in the Highland Green and were immediately drawn to the car's understated simplicity of styling that made the cars we loved as teenagers such classics. Then I drove one! The changes are subtle from the 2006 GT I have been driving for 3 years, but the suspension is firmer and the shifter is more precise. The power difference negligible over the GT, but the car just looks and sounds right. If you grew up driving V-8 muscle cars in the 60's and 70's (or wanted to and couldn't afford to), this is your car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the V6 deluxe auto. Its performance does not equal the T-bird but it costs much less. The ride is not as smooth as the Marquis but it's not luxury or as expensive. It handles much better than the diesel F-250 but that's expected. Sometimes the manual adjustment for the chairs gets annoying especially while driving but I guess drivers should adjust everything first. Cruise control is very precise and simple and even thought the media controls aren't mounted on the wheel, they are still very close. I control radio etc with my wrist resting on the stick. A bit bumpy but great handling</TEXT>

<TEXT>Three to four dollar a gallon gas prompted me to look for something besides my 3/4 ton truck to drive. I didn't want to spend more than $20K but still wanted something fun to drive. I seriously looked at the Solitace, Miata, and Mustang. The Pontiac and Miata were at least $8K more for compariable cars albeit they were rag tops. Ford was offering $5K in rebates bring the price down to $16K drive off. The base Mustang comes with many of the desireables that are option on the other models. I have taken two trips over two hundred miles and and averaged 30-31 mpg on both trips. Combined city/hwy driving this week averaged 24 mpg. The car is a blast to drive and looks great. I am very pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling and styling are what I like most about the Mustang. The addition of a MP3 input and power jack in the center console are also nice additions additions. From a safety standpoint, the Mustang now has side airbags. The gauges are old style but I love them. I also like the fold down rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am 19 years old and own my dream car. Evertime I look at it in the parking lot I think what a cool car, then realize it's mine. Magazines complain about the handling, but the stock tires are rock hard since Ford expects people to actually drive the car unlike other manufacturers (this means they last longer). For the price you simply can't beat the performance you get back in return. As far as the interior, I think the design is brilliant and very clean looking, but most peoples complaints are the materials being on the harder side. Even though Ford sells 130K of these a year, people still smile and wave when you drive by.</TEXT>

The only trouble is the really noisy top latches. The rattle like crazy with the top up. At first, no rattles, but as the weeks went by, the latches were rattling like crazy.

<TEXT>This is my first Ford, I am a GM man. I wanted a sports car convertible, made in America. This was my only choice. I don't understand why Ford doesn't make Mustangs stock that is high performance. Yes you can purchase from Saleen, Rouch, etc, with all the goodies, why not from Ford, at least as options. I added a hurst shifter, chrome 20" wheels, side stripes, things to make it look better. I must admitt I do get a lot of "Nice Car" comments. Probably because I have over 100 coats of wax on it. Mine is a candy apple red. I do love the sound system, I wished they had a hood scoop on my car, even though it was a fake. It does look good. I purchased this car off the lot.

The people from GAS (Pimp my ride) spruced it up with 20 inch Boss wheels, Bassani exhaust, cold air in- take, computer chip and Eibach lowered suspension. In all I've spent an extra 10k on extras and it was well worth it. This care simply can't sit still and it's made to gun it with a mighty roar.

<TEXT>I have been wanting a Mustang since I rented twice on business trips over the past few years. The car is just 100% fun to drive and own. People smile when you pass by and my kids think Dad is the coolest. The car handles well for an solid axle performance car. The ride is not rock hard but firm. Gas mileage is actually decent getting between 19-25 mpg if you keep a light foot. Push the pedal and watch the car go! If you need even more power get the 500 HP Shelby GT500. This will do the job on your Hemi Challenger and the new Camaro. The 18" rims and tires are a must, they fill out the wheel wells nicely. Shaker 500 audio is almost audiophile quality.

<TEXT>This is a fun car to drive. It is well made and has much trunk space too. Most of all it is very economical for a 300hp V8. I am averaging 27 to 29 mpg at average speed of 62-65. If you want to burn the gas tromp on it and it will run and still get 22 to 23mpg. The manual works well, some mechanical noise from 1st to 2nd gear though. One rattle in the dash on right in right hand turns. Bought it $500 over cost and then deducted the Loyalty rebate of $2000 and the additional incentive of $2000 and it is practically a steal! MSRP was $31,430 and out the door for $25,330. </TEXT>

Gas mileage is good considering my right foot is heavy. Got the interior upgrade and it looks great. Love the retro look since I always wanted a 69 Mustang. I have the Pony package and have tinted the windows and put the Roush quarter window covers on it looks impressive. Bottom line is it is fun to drive and doesn't cost an arm and leg. New Challenger might be more powerful but when you drive in Vegas you can only go so fast to the next red light.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lifelong owner of sport sedans from Far East or Europe. Living out a childhood vision of owning a sports car with a great American V8. Car is engineered around the powerful engine, not much else. Unlike products from other domestic makers, the understated styling and lack of cheezy exterior add-on is quite appealing. Obviously, this is a recreational vehicle, so it does not dissappoint, great engine sound, accelaration is pretty linear, and suspension is a good compromise. Not meant to make social statement, so no complaints about ~15 to 24 mpg. Overall, not a perfect car, and not for everyone, but just a fun personal toy to have in your garage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had my convertible now since May. My 2 year old loves going for a top down ride! The wife even likes it. I love the car but it is nowhere near perfect and is about to get some serious competition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the overall interior and exterior design of the car. The engine sounds so sweet! 300hp is nice too. Convertible top seems to work well and I'm okay with the 5 speed auto. Nice to see there is some trunk space and the view under the hood with the plenum cover is sexy. Averaging 19mpg. Comfy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Back in 02 I owned an LS1 z28 camaro and loved it. It had speed, looks, and its only downfall was its drivability in the winter. As a result I purchased an 05 Subuaru sti, which i also loved. However I put a lot of miles on it so I decided to trade it in, and go back to the muscle cars by getting a Ford Mustang. This is anything but a "muscle car". Maybe I've been used to cars that were actually fast, but this car isn't at all. It feels more like a v6 honestly. The looks are very nice, and the interior is ok. The drivability and handling of the car is average at best. Overall, I'm very sad that I purchased this car. It's not what I thought it would be, and I look foward to trading it in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bullitt Limited Edition: I can't take my hands off the steering wheel, this is fun to drive! No longer just a secretary car, Mustang is back with muscle, and character. My Bullitt is getting over 25 mpg, 1800 miles, mostly highway driving at steady 60 mph. Its a hybred of sorts, burns gas, and rubber! Folks in town have noticed, and it attracts attention everywhere i go. Two guys went to the Ford dealer to ask; "What's that dark green Mustang driving around town?" And Ford dealer sold two more in the last two weeks. If you haven't seen the movie "Bullitt", do so, then test drive, you don't need a turtleneck and sport jacket. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car! I love how it handles, I have the automatic and it shifts smoothly and no real hesitation in regards to power. I get an average of 19 mpg around town and got 25 mpg up in the mountains! The V-8 is powerful and easy to control, the exhaust note is fantastic! The California package is a good package for the money, much better than the lame Shelby package ( not the 500). </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was entirely surprised with all this car has to offer (GT Premium). The seating and layout is so much more comfortable than my last sportscar (Porsche Boxster), the interior design is ergonomically well designed, and the on board computer is easy to operate and really helps squeeze out the mpg. Additionally, the power of the engine is incredible, this car performs and drives like nothing I've ever tested. I've never been a Ford type, and I was looking at Corvettes before I test drove the Mustang. But when you consider the vast price difference and the better livability of the Mustang, it's just an amazing value. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the ability to change between 125 colors on the instrument backlight. But my favorite feature has to be getting 29mpg out of a V8 (just keep it under 60mph), especially one that uses only 87 octane!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The limited edition/build 2008 Bullitt Mustang is loaded with fun! this car has great acceleration thanks to the 3.73 gears although it effects your mileage. I've been averaging about 17 mpg even though I put my foot into it with regularity. Another nice thing in this day of high gas prices is that the vehicle runs on either premium or regular unleaded. With regular unleaded, you supposedly lose a little torque, but I can tell you that you don't notice it. A good compromise is the plus grade if available.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Minimalist look ~ it doesn't need a bunch of appliqués to look sinister. Lowering the suspension makes this thing really hug the road. The ride is a bit stiff with the tweaked suspension, but it has its purpose.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I use my GT/CS as a toy, just for special occasions or just to cruise in good weather. I owned a Blue 1965 Mustang 2+2 fastback in 1969, got my orders for Vietnam, then sold the car. I ordered my car due to the retro look, I love it. Vista Blue with all the goodies. I am disappointed in the lack of a quality clear coat on the paint. I have less than 1200 miles on the car, with 2 paint chips on the hood, plus a pebble put a ding in my windshield. I love the 2-tone charcoal and parchment interior. I feel 19 years old again, she is a keeper !</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first American Car purchase in over 20 years, and I am very pleased with my decision. I owned a couple of Muscle Cars in the 60's and loved them despite their many flaws. This car is a true muscle car without the flaws. Comfort, conveinience and power, with a factory warrenty. This is one amazing car for the money. The sad thing is that these won't be available for long. The same thing that killed the original high output V8 vehicles in the early 70's is killing this car today ( oil and it's availability and cost). I know that EPA issues were also involved in the 70's but oil was the main cause. So enjoy it while you can! </TEXT>

<TEXT>First time I saw this as a prototype years ago knew I had to have it. The retro design, interior display panel, and engine sound is what got me; performance is what keeps me. My 1st American car! I'll keep my 4runner, this is purely a toy, and boy do I love it. Black with California package and two tone interior (dove and balck leather) is a must! Black sports stripe on black car sounded real stupid. But it works=chic and sporty. Wish I had that hood scoop. This type of looks, performance, and surprisingly decent gas mileage for under 30k$! You can't beat that, can you? </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2008 Mustang GT is like none other. It is cleary the most affordable sports car out on the market. Sure the Charger has 425HP but they're asking 35+ for it when the Mustang for about 27 can keep up with the Charger if not beat it on the quarter mile. There is nothing better then the sound of a V8 with 320 lbs of torque. The manual transmission is probably what makes this car so exciting to drive. I have currently installed a Flowmaster Exhaust System, K&N Aircharger system, White racing stripes, and a CDC Chin spoiler. It looks mean and it's so easily customized.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking forward to an 08 Dodge Challenger, but the dealerships were going to gouge me. I decided to look at a car to drive for a couple of years and decided on the Mustang GT in Vapor w/Foose wheels and Roush exhaust. It is quick,handles great, has comfoprtable seats and the styling is great; both inside and out. The 3:55 gears pull the car hard but offer a great compromise for general driving. If the car continues to be this strong and is reliable, I may keep it and forget the Challenger. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is my daily driver and it is a fun to drive car. Torque is awesome it will even squall tires in 2nd with traction control on. Interior is decent although mainly built from plastic. I would advise spending the $460 for the upgrade package. I get 23 mpg everywhere I drive although I do take it kind of easy and I drive a manual. Power from V8 is great hard to keep from flooring it all the time. Shaker 500 really Shakes interior and your eardrums. Exterior looks great. I love the late 60s early 70s throwback style. Exhaust sounds great even stock. Sounds the way a V8 should. The ride is good. Sometimes bumpy on rough roads but hey its a sports car. Handles great really hugs curves well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I knew this was the car after I test drove it. The sound even on the V6 was plenty of drama. I'm not looking to street race so the V6 model has very good acceleration and more sensible MPG. I can't wait to drive it all the time. Every time I drive it around, I get stares like it's a Ferrari or something. Probably the over the top stripes. Anyway, I'm very happy about the purchase and this is the coolest car I have owned. (I prefer this over my wife's new BMW 3-Series), that's gotta say something. </TEXT>

Might get some tuning done for some better shifting performance. Gas mileage in the V6 was a little bit better, but then I didn't drive the V6 like I do this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I special ordered this Mustang, and I have to admit that is the way to go. Ford offers the same price whether you buy off the lot or get it custom, so why not get what you want? We live in Pittsburgh, and I have had to drive the car several times in snowy and icy conditions. It handles as well as a rear wheel drive sports car can (with a few cinder blocks in the trunk). The dealer told me the 8 cylinder will not - I definitely believe him now. I love to drive this car, and it looks great in Grabber Orange with the Pony Package added. We also got the ambient lighting, MobileEaze, and interior upgrade package. The accessories are well worth the price. Enjoy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Responsiveness of the V6 is better than I thought. The MobileEaze is a must if you're buying a standard (and why would you not buy a standard?), but the person you're talking to will hear some static.

<TEXT>Just purchased this car 2 weeks ago to relieve my mid-life crisis. I was smiling all the way home, driving it with the top down. This car is all I expected and more. Probably not the most comfortable ride for some (it's not a Lexus), but this is more of a sports car and I do like the feel of the road coupled with the 5 speed manual transmission. Amazing pickup, very easy to go way over the speed limit, seems to always want to go faster, gas mileage not bad for a GT. Leather buckets are comfy. Have always had good luck with Fords, I'm hoping this one will also be as reliable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The retro-looking dash, very comfortable interior, excellent sound system even with the top down(Shaker 500), sound of the exhaust, and acceleration. It appears to be a solidly-built car.

<TEXT>A step up from the GT. From the moment I sat in it, I knew I had to have it. This is coming from a guy who owned 2 Vettes in the past! The seat hugs you, the power shocked me. I've also owned a 1996 Cobra- this thing would maul it. At first glance my car looks like a six cylinder Stang, in fact that's what I thought it was...negative. Also love the fact there's no badges-except for the ponys on the rims and BULLITT faux gas cap on the rear panel. The shaker 1000 sound system is louder than the Bose system in previous cars I've owned (a big plus for me!). The fact that it's 1 of 7000 is reason enough to invest in one, in my opinion, bang for buck, unbeatable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the money this has to be the best performance car available today. This is my second Mustang and when it comes to performance it really screams while delivering great fuel mileage from regular gas. It handles very good and actually is very comfortable on long trips. It does have a fault however. The gearshift lever vibrates and resonates when accelerating which takes away from the otherwise pleasant experience. It also has periodic squeaks and rattles from the front that just can not be found. Drives me crazy and the dealer can not find or even agree that the sounds exist. Ford needs to fix this, my 88 Mustang had none of this noise and it was on a worse platform?</TEXT>

<TEXT>The GT is an awesome design. IMO, it's the sexiest car on the road. It seems well built, very solid, and decently comfy. Interior layout could be more ergonomic, and needs a storage tray. Engine has lots of grunt, but the car seems too heavy to be truly fast. Still, plenty of fun to drive. However, while it's a cool ride, it seems very prone to manufacturer's defects in the drive train. Over the past 2 months, it's been in the shop for nearly 30 days, and both the transmission and rear end assembly have needed replacement. Car is entirely too new to have so many problems.

Sure there's an annoying leather on leather buzz from the manual stick shift and a really annoying creak from the left a pillar but it looks great, cruises like a dream and the Shaker 500 system is great; I even manage an average of 26mpg (75 - 25 highway - town) so I'm far from disappointed with this</TEXT>

I do wish they had the louder exhaust tone from the GT500. The tire noise is evident with the combo that comes on the CS. However it isn't obnoxious. The lower seat cushions could be 2 inches longer for long road trips. Rear seat is really not usable by adults. Can get a car seat in but it is really hard to put a toddler in the seat. It is really a 2 seater like all the previous Mustangs. What makes the GT/CS worth it is it gets looks everywhere we have taken it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Mustang I have owned and it's exciting every time I get behind the wheel. The quality of the ride is as good as most four door sedans. This car will make you look foward to going to work every morning. With the five speed tranny, doing the speed limits I get 27 mpg on the highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a new Ford Mustang V6 manual and it has been what most people consider the ride of their life. I had test drove a few GTs and there is a difference in power, but for an everyday driver who isn't trying to race or see how much fuel they can burn through, it really moves. The transmission is dead on and each gear pulls so hard that you can't hold back smiling and looking around you to see who is watching. I love the way it makes me feel and the rush I get when I go to work in the morning. However, parking in the furthest parking spot next to the curb so that no one hurts her, does get to be a bit of a hike after a while. Go out and test drive one and you will know what I mean. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power for the money, great looks, visabilty of the road from inside, and overall performance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my '08 Vapor automatic for a couple of weeks now. Love the sound of the 300 hp under the hood. I may have to change out the mufflers to MAC or Magnaflow to get a little more bark from it. Back seats are almost useless, but I rarely need to have extra passengers. Fuel mileage is quite good for a car with this power and on regular unleaded. I've already gotten 26.8 on a three hour trip, and it isn't broken in yet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the Torque Thrust wheels, the exterior appearance. Interior My Color guage package is nice. Seating position is good, but car feels big because the doors are up so high beside you.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have owned 40 automobiles and am a professional engineer. I am an official car nut. This is a beautiful automobile, California special. But, if you are 60 years old this car will beat you up when driving our poor roads and I drive 40k per year. Am going back for an Edge. Ford has improved drastically. Had previous SHO and station wagon and piece of junk. These are high quality. Would recommend this car, but only for those who can put up with the "boy-racer" situation. Ford should be commended for their improvements.</TEXT>
