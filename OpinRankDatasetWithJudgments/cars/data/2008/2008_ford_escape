<TEXT>Leaking transmission fluid at 56,000 miles. Dealer found failure in transmission condensor. Internet search found many people having this failure with 08 Escape. Dealer says Ford will not cover this under powertrain warranty but the dealer will use Customer Loyalty Program to cut repair cost to $100. Typical American car manufactured, spend millions to advertise and tell us how good their product is and then find a way to weasle out of fully covering warranty work. Stay away from the 08 Escape. This is my 4th Ford vehicle but Toyota is looking very good at the moment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased my Escape new and loved it, I have had small problems with it. The tires are cupping on the inside. We rotate them when we take it in for service and Ford always tells us that we need new tires but never tells us what the cause is. Another company told us it was the suspension. I also know that the shocks or struts are having issues. When you go across a dip it has a bottom out feel. The vehicle has several rattles and the seats spot w/o any reason. The black moulding around the outside windows raises up when you raise the window up and down and it won't stay down once up. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the size of the vehicle, easy to see out of in all directions. The stereo is the best I have ever had in any vehicle and I have had 15-20. The mp3 plug in it is wonderful and it just adds to the great sound system when you play your mp3...it helps cover up the rattles. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After trying to find the good in it, I have come up with nothing. I am a previous Toyota owner, and I feel very short-changed by the Escape. The inside is very cheap. The apolstery irritates my legs, shows every single water spot, and the foam is hard as a rock. Overall, the interior looks like a 6 year old designed it. When I am on the highway, the engine noise makes it sound like a semi-truck from the inside. Also, I know I have a 4 cylinder, but I can't do more than 20mph uphill, unless I gun it. Then at that point, the engine sounds like it is going to fall out. They should not even make a 4cyl. I do like its auxilary jack for my iPod</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took my 08 escape in today and was told the ac condenser was broke and that was why my transmission fluid was leaking. Have an 8 year warrenty on this car and ofcourse this problem is not cover because it is not part of the drive train. So now its costing me 500 dollars to fix it plus 40 to be told what the problem is. I am not happy at all with ford, if they know this is going on and not doing anything about it they are pretty much screwing us on purpose. I will keep my car but not sure I will buy another. </TEXT>

<TEXT>A local auto repair shop just told me my 2008 Escape's transmission cooler is leaking and has been for a long time. Since purchased, I've taken it to the Ford dealership where I bought it for servicing and they never mentioned this problem. This same dealership said the extended warranty expired 600 miles ago and they can't cover the repair. The dealership is asking almost $600 to repair it. I see other '08 Escape tranny cooler problems on this site. Ford needs to fix this problem. Though a loyal Ford customer for years, I will no longer be buying a Ford if the company can't replace a repeatedly defective part.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 08 Escape new. I love my Escape but noticed that it was having a hard time taking off so it reved up and then slammed into take off mode. I took it in today and they told me that there was a leak in the intercooler leaking transmission fluid. And now I've read other reviews that say they have had the same problem....should there be a total recall, should we all get new cars to replace these that are defective.

<TEXT>Bought our 2008 Escape used with only 8000km on it. No real problems except bad gas mileage. The gas tank is too small and no matter how easy I drive this car I can't even get 500km on a tank. I should be at least getting 600km on a tank. Only had it in to the dealer for regular oil changes and one warranty problem. Has a whining sound now that I have to get checked.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Escape in June of 2008. I drove to Daytona Beach, Florida from Mechanicsville, Virginia and was ecstatic. Drove beautifully and the radio (Sirius) was great until they (Sirius) changed the channel lineup. However, I have had the vehicle in the shop 3 or 4 times for a rattle in the back of the car. The dealer cannot find the problem and keeps giving it back to me and it keeps rattling. Other than that I am pleased with it. Does any body else have any rattles they cannot get rid of? </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2008 Escape XLT 3 weeks ago and am impressed. I traded in my 2006 Fusion and could not be happier. The ride is like a sedan, fit and finish is great, and the new look exterior says class. The satellite radio is way too much fun. The interior could use more padding, but looks good. I have averaged 24 MPG for city driving and this alone is impressive. I can't wait everyday to hop in and drive. I have owned 20 cars in my life, 16 new cars, and this Escape ranks at the top. Thanks Ford! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I turned in my 5 sp manual 98 Explorer Sport for the new 5 sp manual 08 Escape and I love it. The ride is comfy, the gas mileage is great (22-28 mpg) and best of all I can plug in my iPod. It is a fun and safe car to drive with plenty of room for my friends. It is a great car for road trips and vacations.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Escape for just over 3 weeks now. I missed my 2002 Pathfinder at first but after the last snow storm the Escape won me over for good! Handled much better than my old SUV and has a lot more safety features that I wanted in a truck. Got the top line model, love all bells and whistles. I have to say I love the satellite radio, who knew it could be so much fun! Some issues I do have; heated seats turn off after 10 minutes and there is no temp control, 4 speed trans doesn't cut it, gas mileage is not that great- getting 19 mpg on the hwy so far, heavy rain-water gets in the door and spills out the bottom once door is open- dealership says that normal but I have my doubts. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Satellite radio/sound system. Navigation system (although very pricey). Appearance-inside and out. Handling is great. Back-up sensors. Comfort (leather seats are great) Overall this is a great SUV and I'm very happy with my purchase. Just needs a few improvements.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wanted to move into the SUV market from driving a Chevy Malibu. Drove the Mariner, CR-V, RAV 4, & others. The Mariner seemed to cost more just for the Mercury label. The CR-V had a tight suspension and hit every bump hard. The RAV-4 had a cramped ride for everyone. After driving the Escape,I was comparing all the other vehicles to it. So Escape was my choice. 4WD wheel drive was a must for me with MI winters. The combination of that with the stability control, and traction control make me feel safe and more in control of my own destiny. I am paying the same per fill up as I did with the Malibu, but instead of going once every two weeks, I am going once a week. So it doubled.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The safety features are great. Love the 4WD and V6 engine. Love sitting up higher in traffic & having more overall vision. Love the leather, moonroof, Sirius, & aux jack (no more FM transmitter). Ice Blue lighting. Deep front armrest for storage space. Everyone is comfortable, even in the backseat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle! I traded in my '04 Escape 2WD base vehicle that I absolutely came to hate after 2 winters. Don't buy a 2wd Escape if you get snow or ice weather! Spend the money and get the 4WD/AWD, you won't regret it. Since purchasing this vehicle, I have driven in snow storms with confidence (not over-confidence) and it handles amazing. It grips the road and snow and sticks and I even tried to make the tires spin! It handles very smooth, quiet on the highway, is peppy. I find it comfy to sit in and drive. The gas mileage is good for an SUV and handles much like a car. The control panel takes a little getting used to since there are a lot of buttons, but you get used to it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The cool dashboard lighting. The control panel looks very futuristic. Satalite radio, sitting up high, electronic steering, oil changes every 12,000km according to the owners manual, One key with all the functions on it, a good size console to put stuff in (contrary to manual, my purse does not fit)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Needed something that could haul stuff and get me to work in New England winters, fit small family for road trips, and get reasonable fuel economy. The Ford Escape fit the bill. It is the first new domestic car my wife has owned! She drives it more then I do. We got the FWD modal. I am impressed with the traction on very icy and heavy snow covered roads. It is very quit on the highway. We have some good friends that almost bought a Honda CRV, (but decided on a GTI). They thought the Escape is a better buy. I would highly recommend this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Escape in June and have 17000 miles on it already. I love the style and all the features outside and in. But.... the brakes make this awful popping noise every time they get hot. I have taken it to the shop 5 times for repairs. The shop had replaced every bit of the back end, yet they still pop. We brought it to the attention of the manufacturer and the engineers said this "was a normal variation of the vehicle and it does not affect braking performance". Funny thing, they can't identify what is making the noise so how they know it's not affecting brake performance? .your guess is as good as mine. This is my first and last Ford. It's cute and roomy but I can't trust it will last.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I intended to buy a used 2006 Escape, but Hubby saw this one and was hooked. Has every available option from Ford. Very happy with that. Quick and snappy, can park anywhere. Just a lot of fun to drive. Great sound system. We looked at mid-sized SUV's but decided we wanted something smaller and this fits the bill. Lots of power. Weather has been bad nearly since purchase and I drive in AWD a lot, plus with zero degree weather or below, longer warm up periods are required so I am not seeing the great fuel mileage people are talking about. (17 mpg) I hope that chances with the weather conditions. Overall very pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my new 2008 XLT Escape last week and am loving it! The newer body style is what peaked my interest at first-not a huge fan of the older looks. I decided on a nicely loaded Escape over a standard Edge. I am very happy. The interior is different from what I've had in the past, but took no time to get used to. I love the satellite. Very room and clean interior. Sunroof is nice and big. So far the FWD with traction has done well in some higher snow for me. The drive feels great and so far gas mileage is good. I love the convenience package features as well. I got the Kiwi Green color and absolutely love it, everyone notices and likes it. I am very happy with my Escape</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second Escape, got hooked on the interior roominess (at 6'4" its a primary concern). Love the handleability of FWD in the ice and snow while still getting a smooth ride on dry roads. One complaint, the cruise control creeps up in hilly interstate driving. Both of our Escapes can gain 3 to 5 mph when going up hill and then it stays there after cresting. Overall it's a great auto.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Escape 2005 for the new styled 08. Escape just gets better, in comfort, ride, quiteness, handling, and style. I have the moon roof w/satellite Autophile Stereo and this is worth the upgrade. Concerned with the factory installed Continental Tires. Had them on 05' with alot of road noise. So far, this is no issue. This Escape is just fun to drive and own! No complaints with either the 05' and now the new 08'. Thanks Ford!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having driven sporty cars (last car a Mustang) for most of my life and having read your review I was expecting something much more pedestrian than the Escape turned out to be. It was comfortable from the get-go, handles very well and accelerates smartly. It is not choppy riding (try comparing it to a Focus SVT). Friends have commented on how smooth the ride is and how comfortable the car is. The power steering is well-balanced but could do with a bit less assist. I do not find any problem with the braking nor with gentle acceleration. Fuel economy is decent--not horrible but not super. In my case I use a gallon more fuel per week than I used to with my Mustang.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far we put over 6K miles on our 08' Escape. We absolutely love it! It has been the perfect replacement to our aged gas loving Astro van. Geting the EPA rated MPG. For a I4 FWD we have taken it to some bad roads and some mud and it handles it with no problem. It makes you fell like your in a Explorer. It's on the slow side with the I4. We clocked it a around 10-11.5 seconds to 60. We only had one problem. A weld in the gas tank. (baffle) broke and was causing an quite squeak. The dealer replaced it under warranty and gave us a free oil change in less then 5 hours! This car turned a GM family in to Ford buyers for life if we continue to be pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am overall extremely impressed with this vehicle. I purchased it with every available option from ford and am not dissappointed at all. The GPS is amazing totally recommend, Easier to use than Mercedes'non-touch interface. I have driven nearly 3500 miles and average around 20 MPG with the 6 Cyl. The only gripe that i have is with the Cruise control, it average at least 2 Mpg less when it is on and varies greatly in speed up to 5-10 miles per hour. Other than that i love my espcape and personally believe that if Ford keeps up with producing vehicles to this build quality and overall solid feel, while still appeasing to luxury tastes they will be fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Escape a few weeks now, love it, drove everything (rogue, outlander,outback,compass etc.), happy with my choice. I'm getting about 24 mpg on hilly terrain, no hwy, with the AWD that I can't live without where I am. Replaced an Outback, this little suv is perfect. I love the camel interior, much nicer than the stone. The 4cy. is pretty nice after you get used to the tranny, it shifts funny until you develop a nack of driving it. There isn't a need for the 6cy. Never thought I'd go back to a Ford but my husband's new Ford diesel is so nice that it made me take a look at the Escape, very glad I did. It is suprisingly roomy inside and the whole interior layout is very nice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a small SUV that had a decent amt of cargo capacity, excellent safety features, good reliability, 4wd,leather, satellite radio, moonroof, and of course I had to like the comfort, looks and performance. I also wanted one made in USA, but didn't want to pay more than 25K. I have found all of that and more in my 2008 Escape! Also pleased with gas mileage-20mpg combined. Very satisfied with my purchase, and would definitely choose it again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I continue to be impressed with the look and feel of quality I percieve in this vehicle.I drove both the 4cyl and the 6 cyl, and frankly didn't see that the difference in power was significant enough to justify the extra price or lower mpg of the 6 cyl.The interior, a camel color is very well done, and I like the Light Sage Clearcoat color of the paint, as well.I live in a hot climate, so light colors are best, but I was very tired of white, the green is a welcome change.

<TEXT>Too quick to know exactly what happened, but I wrapped my brand new Escape around an electric pole this week and am here to talk about it. '08 handled my 52 MPH head on like a champ! ROLL BAR: In tact. AIRBAGS: Deployed & deflated quickly. NOT TRAPPED: rear glass popped open giving me a quick escape route from the fire. WINDSHIELD: Didn't shatter. Just a little crack in the corner. INTERIOR: Still looked like new! Not even a little mark in the leather, Impact did not send the motor in to the body cavity (or my legs). ME? Didn't have jewelry on, I would not have had a mark on me! This was not only a pleasure to drive and look at, it was a damn good car! I will buy another. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After buying 5-speed manual Honda cars for 30 years, I decided to look at an SUV with a 4 cyl. 5-speed manual. Honda offered automatics only in the 4 cyl., so I looked at several other makes, and the 2008 Escape was by far the best looking with many features that are standard. Cruise control and mag-type wheels were the only options I had to get. I love sitting up high and having all the cargo space. It is a dream to drive! Thanks Ford for offering the 5-speed manual transmission! </TEXT>

<TEXT>We needed a vehilce with some soft roading ability, better ground clearance, and all wheel drive. I did not expect such a high level of options, fit and finish and feel. The Escape is very comfortable and quiet, and feels like much more vehicle than it really is, that is until you need to park, then it shows its size by making parking very easy. I am averaging 25 mpg. and getting 30 mpg on the highway, and thats with only 700 miles on it. I can see why Ford has sold one million of these cars, and with the new improvements, should sell many more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my beautiful Lt Sage Escape this past Monday and I am in heaven! Upgrading from a 01 Kia Sportage to this is surreal to me. The dealer made my purchasing experience totally problem free. I love everything about the Escape. I got the chrome package and I am enjoying the "second looks" My 5 year old son looks like a little prince in his back seat. The moonroof is awesome and the roominess is great! Being only 4'9, I feel so tall :O) especially when I adjust the seat. I really like the information center that tells you how many miles you have left before you get to "E" and the fact that the car lets you know when it needs servicing. I am sold on the Fords now :O)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this SUV! This is my first vehicle purchase. I was driving a '93 Suburban, and this is a great improvement! Great gas mileage, love the interior. Only problems I have had, was, I wasn't aware you needed to ask if a vehicle came with cruise control, I just thought it was a standard feature. I mean, it came with the Stability Control System, but no cruise control. That would have been a selling point for me. Also I was sold the vehicle as a 6 CD player, but it is only a single, no biggie, but why the need for a load button if you can only do one CD at a time?</TEXT>

<TEXT>The wife and I traded in my awesome '05 Japanese sedan for an '08 Escape. We wanted more safety features, ground clearance, and comfort for a similar car payment. I thought I was sacrificing quality and performance, but the Escape blew my wife and I away. We love driving it everywhere and get great comments from family members who own larger SUV's (both foreign and domestic). I was used to the more powerful 2.5L from the sedan but a quick air filter change to a higher performance filter fixed me right up. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My first SUV and I love it! It's roomy, smooth and quiet ride, nice display, great sound system, everything that I wanted plus more at a great price. Size looks bigger than it really is. I was eyeing the CR-V for 9 months and then looked at the RAV4 - couldn't push myself into purchasing one. I think the 2008 Escape beats them both! The Escape was equipped with everything I wanted - many were standard. CR-V would need to add so many options which should be standard. I'm happy I held off. I rode in a 2007 Escape as a loaner and there is a huge difference in ride, noise, comfort, steering, display, and many other features. I just hit 1300 miles and and up to 19.2 mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To date I have 1200 miles on the Escape and have not had, as excepted, a single problem. I use the car primarily as a means to get to work and for the usual weekend project stuff. Overall I am very impressed with the car and am averaging 23.0 mpg (big Texas city driving: 40% highway, 60% city). I also really like the Sirius radio, but was disappointed to learn that there are still the occasional commercials. Also when you go under an over-pass, or in a tunnel, you loose the satellite signal due to a line-of slight limitation. One thing I will pass on is that you need to be careful when folding down the rear sets if you have the leather interiors as the seat belt receptacle tends to </TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning an Explorer, I decided to move down to the Escape. Over all I was unimpressed. I expected more from a Ford SUV and loved my Explorer. I wanted something a bit smaller and was hoping it would handle slightly better. What I ended up with was a lot less room, and an SUV built for someone who could not afford a real one. I would not reccomend this to my friends.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new '08 Escape. It looks great, it?s fast and spacious. Gas mileage in the city has been about 19.8-21mpg. Excellent smooth ride on long trips. We have done 3500 miles in it. One problem - the rear makes a "rocking" noise when the vehicle is just about to stop. The dealer has it for a 2nd time and cant work out what it is? The rear brakes grind when you press the pedal when in P or N. Has anyone else had this problem? Very annoying! I may have a lemon? They should have put 4 disc brakes instead. Overall I love the SUV but this problem is driving me crazy. To date they have replaced the mirror motor on the drivers side, replaced a broken seal on the rear brakes and the left axle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've never driven an older Escape, but I have heard wonderful things about them. I loved this the moment I sat in the driver's seat. I was concerned about the gas mileage on the V6 AWD, but it's not too horrible. I wonder why they still have this old 4 speed transmission? That is one of the few downfalls. I have all the goodies, including XM and sunroof, but the standard stereo is absolutely awful! I knew Ford's stereos were always poor, but they should realize that many people make a huge buying decision in the stereo. I went from a newer VDub, so maybe I am just being a snob on the stereo aspect.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is great, except for the center console display thing. It looks kind of cheesy. I love the new exterior look, very tough looking. Makes it more of a truck, which I like. Generous room for 4 or 5 adults. Good cargo space. Very quiet inside! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The new style 2008 Ford Escape is much more masculine than the past designs. It looks rugged and feels solid, however it clearly is much quieter than the ones in the past. There's plenty of room all around but entry seems about an inch or two too high for my bad knees. I can deal with that because overall, for the most part, this is a winner. Don't give up on Ford yet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a smaller vehicle to replace my '96 Ford Windstar without giving up too much storage. The new Escape XLT fit the bill perfect. The new Escape looks tough and does a great job for what I need. I am getting about 25mpg and very pleased with the looks and performance so far. My wife who drives an Accord V6 coupe would not come near the minivan, now I can't keep her out of the Escape, which is OK, since her Honda is a sweet ride! The Escape 4cyl does just fine in this little truck, it won't set any land speed records, but it has no problem merging with traffic and cruising with the pack, while delivering over 24mpg. Overall we are very pleased with our Escape. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My old car was a Toyota 4Runner, but hated the gas mileage and pain at the gas stations. So I switched to an Escape. At first, I was worried I might lose lots of the space I had in the 4Runner, but a surprise! My Escape has as big an inside space as my old one. I might be wrong, because my old one was a mid- sized SUV, but at least I feel that way and I'm sure about that. My big dog can fit in easily behind the 2nd row seat along with some groceries without a problem. The engine is very smooth and peppy. The acceleration is a little slow, I think, but heck, I'm not a race car driver, nor do I want to waste gas for quick acceleration.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I didn't like the old Escape, so as soon as I saw the new Escape, I went to a dealer and test-drove one. It was much much quieter than the old one my brother is driving. Also, I like the front new grille. The price is also very reasonable compared to ridiculously asking price of a RAV4. I cross-shopped with a RAV4 and CRV and found the starting prices are similar, but once I add the same options a Escape has, the Japanese models cost $3K more. The feul economy is what I expected. It just gives me an everyday enjoyment on the road to work and home. I like the curtain bag, too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>'08 Escape XLS AWD is part of company car plan, best option of the 3 choices offered. Have had vehicle for 6 weeks, and just hit 5000 miles. Overall rate vehicle as fair. Unimpressed with engine power, cabin noise and vibration. Driver's seat is horrible, will fatigue you on short trips. Mileage is good (24 mpg on average mainly hwy). Little features missing like auto headlight shutoff, daylight running lights and seatback pockets. Had issue with vehicle starting after sitting for 2 days during first 1500 miles (imagine what might be in store after it gets 50k or more on it).

<TEXT>I looked at several other Ford options including the Edge and opted for the 2008 Escape because of the overall lighter vehicle weight and somewhat smaller duratec 4 valve engine. This CUV is really excellent. Great new IP and we have the Sun and Sound package with satellite radio and a plug-in for my iPod. It is awesome. There is loads of places to put things with the Rear Cargo Convenience package. The center console has a drop-in insert that holds audio/cell phone stuff. When you remove this insert you can put lesser used items in the space just below the insert. Maps fit very well in map pockets. It handles very well and has RSC, roll stability standard.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have a XLT 4WD and what a dramatic difference from the older versions...especially the interior...thank goodness. This new version is so much better in my opinion. Dramatically quieter and more comfortable and the prices are actually lower than last year's model. We have some very steep hills in our area with gravel roads and the all wheel drive handles them with ease without any loss of traction and the transmission does all the braking on the way downhill with little effort saving my brakes the wear and tear. Love this CUV!</TEXT>

No mechanical problems with it so far at 38k. Brakes and tires will be replaced soon. I did buy an extended warranty for this vehicle, since my faith in Ford was not that good. They probably will never be able to match Honda, Toyota reliability/quality. Too bad. Interior quality like most US brands is poor, leather is paper thin and painted surfaces are not durable at all.

Upon purchase of the 2008 I've had a constant spark knocking that even occurs with an 89 and 93 octane along with more tranny problems to boot. With the purchase of my 2008 Escape came a 60,000 mile drivetrain warranty which covers the transmission and motor. After 40,000 miles I just had to shell out $850 from my pocket because the transmission cooler started leaking which Ford conveniently would not cover under the warranty saying it was not part of the drivetrain. My advice to anyone thinging about buying the Ford Escape, save your money. I will NEVER own another Ford.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 08 Escape since June 07. On average it gets 20 MPG, which is suitable for me. Now, for the issues... first problem was at 24,000 miles, the tires needed to be replaced due to cupping noise despite the fact that I rotated them 3 times. Next, the water pump went at 27,000 miles. At 30,000 miles it was in the shop again for a transmission coolant leak. Also had to replace the black trim by the door windows, coating peels off. Other issues: seat fabric spots--like they've been spilled on a lot, but haven't!-looks nasty and old. Also, annoying rattle somewhere in back. I think that covers it!! Still, overall I love it! Lease is up in a year and I don't want to give it back! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Last week, I was carrying 1100 lbs of household goods from Vandenberg AFB, Lompoc, CA to Malstrom AFB, Great Falls, MT, when I experienced major transmission problems. The Transmission Cooler sprung a leak, causing 5 qts of tran. fluid to leak out. The gears wouldn't shift correctly from first to second gear and the car was stalling at every stop light. After a $900 bill, I thought the issue was the weight, but the car could tow over 3500 lbs, according to the manual. If I were you, I wouldn't buy this car or you will eventually have the same problems. The car is under powered and Ford's manufacturing quality is still poor. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My family and I have owned Ford vehicles for over a decade now and all of us have been pleased with our vehicles. Recently, when it was time for me to purchase a new car, I looked to the Ford Escapes to replace my beloved '97 Ford Explorer. I ended up purchasing a 4 cylinder '08 Escape and I must say, I have not been impressed with it. I bought this car as a fuel-efficient replacement to my '97 Explorer. What I found was that my new '08 Escape actually less fuel efficient than my older Explorer, which was made over a decade earlier. I was so impressed with my '97 Explorer that it blinded me into a brand loyalty towards Ford. But now after buying this new, smaller, </TEXT>

<TEXT>We do a lot of landscaping around the house so we purchased this SUV primarily to provide us a way to move larger materials around that wouldn't fit in a regular car. For that task it's a great vehicle, the fold down seats in the back (though a multi-step process) provide a lot of space that allows storage/transport of most anything. We were so impressed with the quality of the Limited package we've also used the car as our primary vehicle to drive to and from work. We've leased this vehicle, and I suspect we'll keep with the Escape next year when the lease is up. Initially we favored the fuel economy of the 4-cylinder, but after test driving both I was sold on the V6's extra power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought mine 2 months ago as a daily driver so my Mustang can stay in the garage. The second day I had it, the Chicago winter turned extreme for the next 6 weeks. Ice storms, snow falls averaging 3-5" 3 days a week, -40 degree wind chill and this little SUV was a pleasure to drive. This car is outdoors and it started with no problem when we dropped way below zero and the 2WD handled the snow. I was worried buying a used car with 20K on it and no history, but the car is made well and I had no problems. I love my little Escape. I would not have made it to work on many of those days in my Mustang.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this Escape after owning an Explorer for many years & I love it. I did a lot of research on this vehicle and came to the conclusion that this was my Explorer but smaller & hoping that it had better gas mileage. No real problems to report as yet, except the rear brakes screech when backing up, the dealer says this is normal? I work for an auto shop & my boss would shoot us if we told a customer that! (the neighbor has a 2008 Escape too & his rear brakes do the same thing)I have a 100k warranty & still have the 36k warranty.Overall a great deal. It drives smooth, pick up could be a little better, but it is comfortable and drives very nice. </TEXT>

There is no vibration, road noise is minimal and I can see without blind spots even with teenagers in the backseat. I am a 5'9" woman and have no difficulty with seat positioning or steering and love the fact that it turns on a dime. Turns so smooth- Just like my old 76 Bronco from high school. Also have a toddler and the carseat latch features are so easy. Plenty of 'kick' room for her legs too. Perfect height for placement of little ones, she can see out and I have no more back aches from the bend and stretch of buckling her. </TEXT>

Starting with a steering problem. The left boot shaft keeps slipping. Ford has informed me that they have 'no fix' and to just keep bringing it back in. replaced shocks, struts, set toe, recalibrated steering wheel, caster camber,alingment etc. all within 3,000 miles. Now at 8,000 miles, I have taken it in for a right front half shaft leak, cv boot, which leaked on and blew the engine sensor. Replaced the engine sensor, oxygen sensor, instrument panel. Now the steering is sloppy again and taking it back again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>4 months of owership now and am quite pleased with the car. In my review in 06/08 I mentioned I went from a Focus hatchback to the Escape since Ford discontinued the hatch, why? ask Ford, it was a great auto. The 4 cyl. is not for you if you like 0-60 in record time. It will get you to interstate speeds but not in a hurry, just fine for me. Cruises along very nicely. Cruise control smooth. Electric PS great. Lots of storage, cavernous with the back seat flat. 24+ MPG around town with AC. Seats I had described as a bit hard are now quite comfortable. Still miss a telescoping steering wheel but power driver seat gives a satisfactory position. All controls illuminated in blue at night, excellent.</TEXT>

Compared to the 02 model, the exterior and interior are from two different worlds, but the engine is still the same. It's real slow of the line, feels like I need to press gas pedal down further to get going. Can hear the engine a little too much, much not that bad with the free 6 month Sirius subscription they give you, I can deal with it.

<TEXT>The first time I drove my Escape I knew I loved it and wanted it. Comfortable height for getting in and power when I need to pass and pick up speed. Lots of room and great visibility. After 10 months of ownership I opened my door at the mall for Christmas shopping and the top bolt fell out pulling the door from the hinge. Quick reflexes I caught the very heavy door and managed to lift it and secure the hinge. The bolts on the doors secure upward and the safety had fallen off without my knowing, thus every time I opened the door it loosened the bolt a bit more. Apparently a hinge defect. The hinge was replaced with reinforcements around the bolt. The door doesn't always shut properly now.</TEXT>

I was only 3 years into owning my Hyundai at that ime so I thought, in a couple of years when I am looking to buy a new car, I need to test drive an Escape. Time passed, and I read up on all the small SUV's in my price range out there. I noticed how entusiastic almost all 2008 Escape owners were, so that was my first and only test drive. Upon climbing in I immediately noticed how high the vehicle sets without feeling "top heavy". All the dash controls were laid out very ergonomically while also looking modern, stylish, and upscale. Driving it was as easy and fun as I had thought it would be.</TEXT>

The interior is a nice Stone color and I love how the cupholders are positioned. Almost like I have 4 of them to use.The purchase of the Escape was wonderful.

<TEXT>My experience of the Escape has been a nightmare! I am on my second 2008 Escape this year. The first one had braking issues and after being in the shop for an entire month, they exchanged me for another 2008 Escape. This one has been no different. I have owned this one for 9 days and already it will be in the shop for 3 days for ABS, Traction control and a loud Vibration that actually slows the vehicle down. All the issues with both have been rear end and braking issues. Not good! I have been in rental vehicles for 5 weeks now. So not only did I get one lemon, I actually have had two!

<TEXT>It was time to look for a vehicle with better gas mileage while providing my first priority, roominess! My 2006 Grand Cherokee, my third, only got 15.5 MPG around town, about 75% of my driving. I need room and a hard rear floor for scuba tanks, coolers, spearguns, golf clubs, telescopes and, oh yeh, business samples. Also, I'm 6'3" and the new Ford Escape fit as well on me as my much thirstier Grand Cherokee. I mentioned I was looking for much improved mileage, so when I saw this Vista Blue 5-speed I said let's take a test-drive. A winner in terms of what I was looking for. Sold! My first tank averaged out to 22.8 MPG and I probably did only 20% highway. Very pleased. </TEXT>

The ride is smooth. The V6 packs plenty of power while maintaining a fairly solid fuel economy (~25 mpg for our use) The exterior design just looks beautiful and makes you want to drive out to Yosemite National Park for a campout.

<TEXT>I recently purchased a Ford Escape. I wasnt looking to buy at the time but we needed a bigger car since we wanted to expand our family. I test drove it the first day and fell in love with it. I loved that I sat higher and felt safe having my child in the car with me as well it was silent and handled great. Didn't even know the engine was on half the time. I owned a Dodge Neon SXT and it was cramped and small and at times and it wasn't big enough for the two of us so had to upgrade. I have owned 3 Dodges, 1 Ford, and 1 Chevy. Needless to say I am very impressed. I dont know what I get gas mileage wise yet. I only have 1100 on it but I'm looking forward to seeing what it gets!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Editors get paid to find weak points in all vehicles. Overall I think the Escape is a "sleeper" in today's gas guzzling SUV, 4.00/gallon gas world we live in. I mean this lil SUV is known for been fairly good on fuel (19-26 mpg) and is fairly inexpesive. Yea its not perfect but the fuel efficiency alone is the prime reason I got it! As that's hard to find in an SUV. Decent factory sound sytstem, and plenty of room. I love my 08 Escape, it's fun to drive! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first SUV, upsized from the Taurus (had 2 previously). This is the vehicle I always looked at but until the new look came they just weren't what i was looking for, but now I have my "lil truck" and I couldn't be happier. It's a bit smaller seating wise compared to my Taurus but this is can be overlooked as this is a second vehicle. There is a bit less storage than in my car but plenty of room for groceries and shopping. Its comfy and smooth ride. It's cheaper on gas than my car was also, which to everyone these days is a must! I love my Escape.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the MP3 hookup, and the fold away seats are great. I purchased the cargo cover and it just makes it look that much better. Can't say enough about it. Only thing missing is my car starter, which I am sure will come along.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 185K miles on my Taurus I decided to go Ford again, Even though I had GM card and accululated $2K I bought the Escape after my first test drive. Love the look of it, love the interior. I do not like SUV's with shift on the dashboard - looks silly, love it on the Escape. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been debating for some time now on trading my 2003 G35 coupe and 1997 Chevy S-10 in. We wanted to consolodate vehicles. So, my wife suggested we start looking around. It was hard parting from my G35, and I was not sure that the Escape would be a good replacement (as flashy or fun). The vehicle that we purchased was a 2008 Limited 4WD that was pratically loaded. My wife sat in the front seat and was love at first site. Once I started driving it around town I fell in love as well and forgot all about my G.......(what).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Turned in 05 Focus 4dr hatch w/12000 miles. Would have gotten another but Ford discontinued hatch. Need a vehicle to lug around all sorts of stuff (Home Depot) etc. The Escape XLT 4cyl auto. was all that was left for my budget. Stayed with Ford for great discount. Car is different. The 4cyl auto is not as snappy as the Focus but adequate. Like the driving height but miss the telescoping wheel. Electric power steering is great as is the handling. It has a very solid feel when driving. Seats a bit hard but may improve with use. 4 speed auto should be 5 and is not as smooth shifting as the Focus. Cruise control fine. Interior satisfactory. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Escape, the first being a 2002 Ltd. I returned my Volvo XC90 at the end of its Lease. Decided to do some economizing. Get away from premium gas and buy something with better mpg. The improvements/features over my 2002 are substantial. Most things have been improved greatly, some things fall under "if it ain't broke why did you try to fix it...but made it worse?" Parking brake release and twist locks on roof rake. Though, 5-6 speed trans would be nice. The 4 speed shifts very smooth compared to the 6 speed in my Volvo. But, with all that I am enjoying the truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was a little skeptical about getting an American made car because they don't hold their value as well but I just didn't want to spend over $30K for an SUV. We wanted an SUV to fit two kids and a dog, and the Escape is perfect! Tons more room than our tiny Honda Civic but not a gas guzzler like Explorers and such. The Escape is great on gas, handles very well, the turning ratio is better than other SUVs we test drove. It's very inexpensive to insure too! Smooth and comfy ride. Love my Escape, in the future we'll look into the hybrid!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I sold my Yukon XL and wasn't ready to move down in size to a car so I had never really thought about the Escape because I wasn't crazy about the older body style. My Mom talked me into test driving one from the dealership where she worked. I loved it! My daughter loved it too. So, I figured out the colors and options I wanted and the dealership found one for me. I love it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I brought the 2008 Ford Escape as a late Christmas gift to myself! I have been driving my husbands ChevyS10 pickup so this was a nice change. I love the feeling of still sitting up high and love they way it drives. It is fun to drive. I absolutely love my moonroof! I am taking it on a long trip in 2 months from Florida to Connecticut and I am sure it is gonna be a much more comfortable ride than riding in the Chevy truck. I am actually looking forward to this trip. Gas mileage is about 19 in the city which isn't too bad. Not sure about highway since I haven't really taken it too far yet on the highway.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>it is</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Switched from awd to 2wd -- and I'm doing alright (not needed in tx). Needed room for dogs, with better mileage than I got with my wagon. This is it! Worst case, my first mileage estimate is 27 mpg with 70 hwy/30cty. Better than expected! I had to find something under 20k, and used wasn't practical--I rack up the miles. It has my bare necessities, but I miss the seamless cargo space of my wagon (the Escape has gaps, with dangerous pins in them)--until my custom mats are made, I'll have to keep travel crates in the car. Other than that, why are they still doing drum brakes? </TEXT>

<TEXT>Switching from a Subaru Outback to this is refreshing. It feels lighter than the 'ru ever did, and gets 8 mi/gal more (judging from the first fillup). Drove CR-V, Rav, and the new styles had horrible visibility! Escape still has it. And the price is so much better! I got a new base model for the same as a high-mileage used of the others. While it is reported to be more sluggish, I don't find anything fatally bad about it. It suits my needs as a dog trainer, without breaking the bank at the pump.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought I would never go back to American made cars again. I had a 2001 CRV until the trans died a few months ago. The Escape is rugged looking, sits higher, has a very smooth ride and fun to drive. It has a lot of interior room. Lots of head room and a quiet ride. Love the crome grill and the the keyless doors and back latch. Just gettting 18 MPG in city so far. Also brakes are a bit soft. Hope that will improve. Really enjoying the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I replaced my 02' Mercury Mountaineer- 6cyl-AWD-that was getting about 12miles to the gallon for this great 08 Escape. I get on average of 23-25mpg and I love it. Everytime I go to the gas pump I smile--except at the prices of course. I had test driven the Jeep Patriot and Liberty but wasnt satisfied. Once I got behind the wheel of the Escape I knew. I love the Vista Blue Metallic, it's gorgeous! This is my 1st vehicle with a sunroof and it has spoiled me. I also love the satellite radio-NASCAR! This is my first new vehicle-I definitely made a wise choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After a week and a half I'm very impressed. If Mazda had had the right colors I would have had a Tribute because I really enjoyed my 05 Lapis Lasuli blue one - but a tree fell on it while I was driving. So the Escape's exterior color and other features were attractive. It has more room than some compact SUVs. The 5 speed manual really makes it perk up performance wise and I think the combination of 4cyl and manual will save me a little gas money. I just feel more in control of the car with manual. I'm waiting to see if the standard tires Continental Crosstrac wear out as fast as they did on my Tribute - 30,000 miles even with servicing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had pickups and large suvs past 20 years. Finally gave up f150. This Escape is so fun to drive, comfortable and quiet cpmpared to CR-V and Rav4, loaded and only cost 21000, v6 and 4wd. So far 22 mpg, better if cruise not used. Interior finish is neat, and exterior is sharp and finish is superb. We like this so much we are thinking of trading wife's Expedition for another.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 01 Ford Ranger 4x4 for my Escape, and love my Escape. I use it for commuting, and pleasure - mileage on highway is about 24-25. In town it drops to 18-19. The V-6 is adequate for power. Handling is what sets this vehicle above others I tested. AWD is excellent - no problem with snow, ice, sleet. Inside is comfortable, and good visibility. We take it more than our Lexus for around town.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently traded in my 2005 Ford Escape for a 2008 Ford Escape. I went over that vehicle with a fine tooth comb. Then I did it again. I drove the Vue Red Line, Cx7, CRV, Element and an X3. The Ford won hands down! This vehicle was made for me. I got the Satellite Radio, Monnroof, Convenience Package, Sport Wheels and too many other options to list. I have had complete strangers come up to me and ask to take a look because they havent seen one and want to take a peek. Its amazing! I have had it for 3 weeks and already have 1600 miles on it. It's just FUN to drive! Ford has done an amazing job on this redesign! This is my 4th Ford. I wont even look at a Chevy! </TEXT>
