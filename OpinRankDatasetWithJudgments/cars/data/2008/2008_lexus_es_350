<TEXT>The Lexus ES350 pampers the driver and passengers in quiet isolation. The ride quality is best in class and fuel economy is excellent for a car this size. I averaged 27.5 mpg over 37K miles and typically get 31 mpg on highway (+75mph). I do a lot of highway driving and the New England winters are tough on any car, but the paint on the Lexus has more chips than my 6 year old Honda. Recommend getting dealer applied plastic film on hood to protect the new eco-friendly paint. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you love the feel of the road then you will love this series of Lexus because due to the stiff suspension you will feel every bump in the road. If you are broad in the beam get a different car. When I drove the car I had to shift my position numerous times to feel comfortable - the seat is not wide enough for a larger than average person. There is a wind noise on both sides of the windshield that should never be heard from a car in this price range - and owners of the same style Camry have reported the same noise as well but Toyota/Lexus report that this is normal. If you are long waisted (short legged) get a different car - it is impossible to adjust the height for comfort.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car goes like a bat out of hell and will stop on a dime. Great air conditioning but the heater had a hard time maintaining the proper temperature. The tilt and telescoping steering wheel on entry is a nice touch. The tilt down side mirrors in reverse are fun - for awhile - then distracting.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in an Avalon and I am truly impressed by the difference in ride and feel. The steering is ultra smooth with no play or noises. Road noise is minimal. The backup camera and parking assist radar has turned out to be a truly useful feature. The seats are very comfortable and not fatiguing.The adaptive headlights are pretty nice as well. After having used the navigation system I can't imagine not having a car without it. Next time out I may get another ES or perhaps try one of the big boy Lexuses.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased this car new. Has a good ride, not as quiet inside as I would have expected, dealership says it's the wind shear from the side mirrors! When I have to accelerate a bit hard, the catalytic converter smells really bad. I had this problem with my 2005 es300 too. Does anybody else experience this? Also the driver's side seat belt buckle digs into the back of the seat and marks up the leather when you get in the car. The heated seats don't get very warm as other cars I have drove with this feature. The bluetooth does not always work properly. The front tires wore out at 10K and I did have them rotated by the dealer. The paint scratches very easily. Major torque pull could have accident.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The headlights are nice and bright. The radio produces good sound quality. Has a roomy front interior and plenty of trunk space. Rides nice except for cabin noise (sounds like you're driving with a window open). I like the way the car looks, had the windows tinted.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well it should be better than it is. The engine sounds like a Diesel for the first 10 min. The steering is too light, it has a nervous feel when cornering. The transmission has not been fixed since the 2007 recall. It down shifts very abruptly and shakes the whole car. It drives smooth and gets good gas mileage. The center console is an engineer's joke. It always opens (what where they thinking with that button). Hopefully not the same guy that developed the engine with the Diesel noise. I can't say I will buy another one. This was my first Lexus. Oh, and the paint scratches with just a wash. At this price point you have to pay for XM satilite. The Chevy Cobolt comes with it for $11,000. PLEASE!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a well-rounded mid size luxury car. The ride is impeccably smooth and quiet, the controls (with the exception of the seat heaters) are well placed, and the fit and finish are superb. My only complaint with this car is the 6 speed transmission. It tends to hesitate slightly when cornering. I'm not a "spirited driver", so this does not bother me tremendously. The gas mileage is better than expected. I average around 24 mpg (mostly city driving). On the highway, I get 30 - 35 mpg. This car is intended for drivers who value comfort and serenity over handling. Don't get me wrong, the car does handle well but there are sportier sedans on the market (but none ride as well).</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are a driver, this is not your car. Transmission control is poorly designed, hurts economy and has safety issues as it coasts. Too quick to downshift on slight inclines. Driver has no control! Handling feel is not too bad. Pushed hard, exhibits roll. Front drive in any car has handling problems. This car is powerful and has torque steer that can take the car in dangerous directions if pushed hard from a dead stop. Be prepared if hard acceleration is planned or required. Inside lighting is extremely poor. Design goof again. Paint may be thin and prone to scratches. Do not have the dealer service. Charges are 4x what you can by at a service shop. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice comfort features. Sound system is excellent. Car is a silent cruiser, nice for traveling. Headlights, fog, and driving lights may be configured for automatic on/off, daylight on. Push to start keyfob very convenient. The car is very pleasing to the eye. Despite tranny, still has good economy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had many vehicles over the years. Never knew that driving could be this enjoyable. Mine is Ultra Premium with 4500 miles. Levinson sound is great. Call it my magic carpet. Black with tan interior sends a chill up my back every time I enter it. Doors close like luxury coach. Could use more aggressive exterior styling. Wish it was AWD but without the floor lump as on GS model. Hope the suspension feels this good in years to come. Slight delay in acceleration when punching gas pedal takes getting used to. But at 55 I'm in it for comfort not racing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Black exterior with gold logos/tan interior. Solid chrome grill stands out. Levinson sound and awesome ride quality. Drove from Long Island to 250 miles N. of Toronto on 1 -1/2 tanks of fuel. I'll be spending more time driving in the States to enjoy superior roads. Just found a new hobby to enjoy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my first new Lexus ES350 looking for a quieter more comfortable ride. I was shocked that the injectors were so loud we thought we had a diesel engine. It is worse when it is cold. I guess that is why they had it in the showroom when we tried it out. I returned to dealer and they said "Thats the way it is". Anti-locking brakes shook the car (ABS). I had to have the rotors turned on this new car. Wind noise in the front windows, tires out of balance and they roared. Wind noise repaired (I think). Cup holders too small. Not enough interior storage. (They did give me a Lexus ball cap.) Would I own another Lexus? Never!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I never thought I'd want a Lexus; then I drove an ES350 and it made me forget the competition. The ride is incredibly smooth but still very solid, not floaty. The car is very quiet. I like the standard radio; sound quality is fine for me. Definitely drive a few and drive for a while; I think the seats are very different without the Premium Plus package; w/o the PP package the lumbar support was just painful; PP seats with base extender feel very different; very comfortable for me. Gas mileage is impressive for a V6. Controls seem well placed. I like the power outlet in the glovebox; you plug your phone in to recharge it and use the bluetooth to make calls.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth, solid ride. Super quiet. Keyless entry and start. Comfortable seats. Bluetooth phone interface. Rearview camera. Big nav screen. Lots of rear leg room. HID lamps/steerable headlights. I get a kick of the steering wheel that moves out of your way automatically when car is turned off.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our ES 350 new. So far we are VERY pleased. We have nearly 6,000 miles on it and our over-all fuel economy is right at 30 mpg! Highway we will get 34! Very pleased with that. The car is fun to drive and very spirited in acceleration. We opted for the upgraded wheels, pin striping and window tinting. That gives the car a really nice look. Also the all weather floor mats are good looking addition. Gives it a more sporty look. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just leased an ES 350 coming out of a Acura TL. We have found the electronics, including radio and bluetooth to be inferior to the TL. Disappointing. Also some of the features like keyfob by driver (1 or 2) is not available on ES 350 as it is on TL. Very disappointing that satellite radio was not included nor did the dealers stock cars with the option. Had to have dealer add satellite radio at an exorbitant price. Acura TL has this standard. A car in this price range should have an excellent radio; excellent bluetooth; and include satellite radio. Could be the first and last Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very nice car. I will buy another one. The ride is extremely smooth and the gas mileage was surprisingly better than advertised for highway driving. It took me a while to get used to the push button start, I have caught myself a few times just leaving the engine running while trying to exit the vehicle, the engine is that quiet. The memory seat and steering wheel settings don't set, every time I get in the car after my wife drives I have to move the seat back before I get in. Roofline should be higher, I often have to adjust my seat to avoid touching the interior ceiling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had 6 new cars and this is the most luxurious yet. I love all of the fancy features. It is a joy to drive, gets EXCELLENT gas mileage and is very comfortable for my 40 mile roundtrip commute each day. I did a lot of research prior to purchase and the only other car that beat the LEXUS was the 2009 Jaguar XF. Unfortunately, my budget wouldn't allow that but I'm very happy with my second choice.</TEXT>

We have had our ES 350 for about a week and are loving it. We are averaging almost 30 mpg!! We live in the country and do a lot of highway driving. Only disappointment is the audio. The brochure and website are misleading. Makes you think if you opt for the navigation you will have the Mark Levinson. Not so. Very pleased overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Lexus; traded in my 2001 ES 300, which I also loved. But this is a totally different car; plush, powerful, yet still quiet and reliable. I'm impressed with the fit and finish of the dash and controls, and love the Bluetooth compatibility. This may just be my all-time favorite car (except for the '66 MGB that drove me to the poorhouse when I was young). Plenty of power, yet smooth as silk.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th ES, the last being an '04. The '08 is a vast improvement in performance and design - best car I've ever had. Ultra Lux pkg with all options except dynamic cruise control. Levinson stereo is outstanding. Answers to some problems of other reviewers: 1. Mirror tilt can be deactivated by keeping mirror adjust swith in the center position. 2. Unlock button on key fob can be linked to memory system so seats can adjust pre-entry. 3. Glove box is lit, but only when tail lights are on. 4. Regular fuel is OK, but performance is better on premium. 5. When entering destinations in the nav system, be sure you're in the proper map zone for the address - not your present location.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Levinson stereo, 5th generation nav system (much more intuitive than others), voice command system, backup camera, keyless entry/start, additional rear seat room, increased horse power, interior quietness, improved handling - but still some body roll in corners.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my ES350 in January 08 and it is a comfortable, luxurious and beautiful inside and out. I considered the Buick Lucerne, Acura TL, Infiniti G35 and BMW 3-series. The ES won out on looks, performance, comfort, quiet ride and gas mileage standards. The car certainly turns heads and gets stared at. It's very roomy and the trunk space is adequate. The interior controls are not busy and very easy to operate. This is my second Lexus. I always heard that once you drive a Lexus, nothing else will live up to it. I agree!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Lexus, but oh, what a disappointment. Love the ride and the power, but the car has developed squeaks and rattles everywhere. The whole panel behind the rear seat rattles/vibrates when I turn the radio up. The glove compartment door latch broke and won't close. It takes several tries for the voice-recognition system to get the numbers right. The interior materials are cheap: the glove compartment and coin doors are flimsy, and quality of the leather is third-rate. Also, this is not a car for tall people; all-around visibility is VERY limited; the roofline is low, the windowsills are very high and the windshield is very inclined, even the rearview mirror gets in the way.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at many competing vehicles, including Mercedes E-Class, we settled on the ES 350 Pebble Beach edition, with nav and the usual amenities. The Lexus is quite reminiscent of the Benz E Class in power, room and fun to drive. The stats are quite close. Lexus keeps surprising us. We had one of the first RX 300s, and have had the ES 300. This new vehicle blows the predecessors away, with power, quiet and technology (as expected). On the minus side, the visibility could be improved with a higher windshield and back window. On the plus side is the ride quality, which is why we went back to Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was concerned about spending the extra money to get the Lexus ES 350. However after owning one for several months I love the car. I looked at the Acura TL, MB C300, and Infiniti G35, before deciding on the ES 350. The car is very quite and smooth riding with plenty of power. The other day I got on the interstate and before I noticed, I was doing 90; with the ride and low road noise I didn't notice the speed. All the feature are easy to access and use. The car has plenty of room for 4 adults. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Lexus lease and I am 39 yo. Each time I looked at other options, including the BMW, Mercedes, etc., and chose Lexus. For me, it was the best value for the money, providing the luxury and comfort that I wanted. Quite frankly, I am more interested in a luxury ride than a sporty one. I have never had a problem with any of the cars. My only wish for the Lexus was a little more of a sportier feel which the ES 350 achieves and then some. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Lexus. I have received this model as the loaner during service at our dealership over the last 7 years and am impressed at the changes between the ES300, 330 and this one. The ride is sportier and quicker than previous models without sacrificing comfort. The relative value is unbeatable. The price for what you get is pretty much unmatched in any other cars I looked at in this price range. Reliability is also going to be better than BMW and Mercedes. I highly recommend this car.</TEXT>

No comparison to the 06 in that area.

<TEXT>Comparing to my 2004 ES 330 it is a slight improvement. Keyless entry and telescoping wheel are nice additions. Engine/transmission are a slight improvement but engine is louder. Tires are not as good as was on 2004. Lexus has cut some corners hopefully not in area of reliability. Controls for interior lights are much too confusing and don't seem to make much sense. Battery is down graded from 2004. Center console is a joke compared with 2004. Manual shifting (s) mode is ideal for snowy/icy driving. Handling is just o.k. Four wheel drive might be a good feature for the future. Extra cost for an XM radio is rather high and location of special antenna is not good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was pleasantly surprised by my city driving mileage. At present I have just under 2000 miles on the vehicle and have averaged 23-24 mpg. The mpg indicator helps me to manage my driving habits, I hope to exceed the 24 mark once the car gets a couple of thousand more miles. I believe for the $ this vehicle is very tough to beat especially given the fact if I do need service it will be done at the Lexus level. I am very pleased with the ergonomics, ride, styling, and performance. I am recommending this vehicle to friends/family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought it over the Lunar New Year, got everything except Ultra Luxury package. Drives like it should. Have yet to take twisties but the car should be able to hold its own despite not being a sports sedan. Otherwise, wonderfully smooth and quiet--and fast! A few chinks in its armor of perfection: despite the stylish profile, the roofline is low as a result. I am just under 6'1" and I cannot sport an explosively spiky hairstyle in this car (I love contradictions). The glove compartment is unlit, which can be an annoyance at night.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in an 2006 Acura TL for the 2008 Lexus ES 350. I loved the TL but I love the ES 350 that much more. Totally diferrent drive as the TL is a much more aggressive car. This car feels much roomier and everything put into the car is of top notch quality. Little disappointed in the stereo but overall am very satisfied. The gas mileage as well as the ability to not have to use premium gas is much improved over the Acura and the displays are very easy to read.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second ES. I previously owned a 2004 ES 330 and found it to be a great vehicle. When the ES 350 was released I knew I had to have one. This car is so fun to drive and has all the bells and whistles you would expect, and more, in a luxury sedan at this price point. I appreciate the quiet ride and the improved power. The seats are insanely comfortable and all of the controls are right at my fingertips. The competition can't match the quality materials and handling of the ES 350. Lexus has an edge that the others can't match.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the '08 ES350 over the '08 C-Class , '08 new Accord, & '08 TL. Very happy with the car. Extremely quiet and luxurious. Very large interior. A bit larger car then I wanted, but that is a personal preference. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great nav system and bluetooth phone works great through the system. Asked several people, and they couldn't tell I was on a speaker. Very quiet & smooth ride. Backup cam has a nice wide lens that lets you see well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had the car for four weeks and still so very excited about it. Really look forward to driving it!! Just a pleasure to drive and operate all it's features. This car really coddles its driver and passengers. It feels like it's worth every penny of the price when you are behind the wheel. Takes curves and corners surprisingly well! Can't say enough good things about it!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Level of luxury, feature content, build quality, driving pleasure.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned the car for 5 weeks now. I love the quiet ride and the feel inside. I love the bluetooth option for it's safety and convenience. When I go easy on the gas pedal, I get 28 MPG overall. When I need to pass, the power is there. You gotta try it to believe it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With the Bluetooth connection to my cell phone, I just push a button and say "call by number" and then say the number and it make the call.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been a Toyota fan most of my life and always thought a Lexus was a fancy Camry - Once I drove my ES 350 I knew I was so wrong. Interior fit & finish is flawless and the MPG is a consistent 27-28 in town and 34 on the hwy. Hard to beat this with 272 hp V-6. Problems I've read about transmission and others simply are not true at least with this car. My wife and I have to fight over who gets to drive it. It's quick, safe as can be and with a spoiler, gold package, large tires it's a real "head turner". It is truly a great car and the extras you get over a Camry XLE for example are well worth it. Resale value of a Lexus is awesome.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 8 years with my volvo S-80 it was time for change. I looked at the new S80 and the Toyota Avalon. The S80 was much like my 2000 and too much money considering the questionable quality of my old car. The Avalon was a good driving car but seemed a bit boxy. Driving the ES 350 was the clincher. Fun, quiet, responsive and comfortable. The Lexus trunk is a better shape than either of the others and the opening much larger. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The tilt-down side view mirrors in reverse and the auto dimming. The quiet ride. Quietest car I have ever driven. A responsive driving machine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my ES 350 with the ultra luxury package. This car is the model of refinement. The interior is top notch with quality material throughout. It's one of the quietest cars I've ever driven. You cannot hear wind noise or road noise. The car has no rattles and is silent at highway speeds. The car rides very smoothly, but still handles very well. While it's no sports car, it handles better than most people would expect. With the 3.5 liter V6 you have more power than you could ever need. The car merges into trafic with ease, and passing on the freeway could not be easier. Even when you punch the engine, it's silent and does not intrude into the cabin.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mark Levinson stereo is great. I love the isolation from the outside, and the ride quality cannot be beat. Fit and finish is top notch. I love the panoramic roof. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am not a car fanatic nor do I know much about mechanics, performance, etc. What I will tell you is that I just traded my 1997 Mercedez C280 in for the Lexus ES 350. I drove the 2008 BMW 328, Mercedes C300, Cadillac CTS, Audi A4 and A6. The Lexus is by far the most comfortable and quite ride. More power then you could possibly need and the nav and audio system is a dream. The car has a beautiful interior with too many safety features to list here. Lets just say I love this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, nav system, back up camera.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>LOVE THIS VEHICLE</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Just purchased the 08 ES 350. Have driven it about 3 weeks and put over 1400 miles on it. Great car. Very quiet and comfortable. I also own an Acura TL which I love, but there is no comparison to the comfortable ride in the ES. Great car. I read all the reviews for the 07 and decided to wait for the 08s before I bought. I have not experienced any of the problem with down shifting reported in the 07s. Be careful with the remote in your pockets against other keys. It could accidentaly let the windows down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The nav is great. Took a while to learn the features. Cool seats are a plus in the state of NC. Great ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the second new Lexus I have owned. I thought my 2004 was nice car, however, the new options and upgrades on the 2008 model 350 surpass my expectations. I highly recommend the options of the back-up trunk camera and the headlight system that moves as you turn. I cannot believe the coverage of the road. Performance, comfort, looks and increased HP again more than meets my expectations. I look forward to driving this car for many years to come. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This of course is a rollover year for ES 350. I didn't really notice the new mirrors, but I did notice the improved interior lighting. Anyone that compares this car to a Camry needs to drive them both head to head. From the moment you get in the ES 350, you know that you are in a luxury car. I have owned 5 series BMW, Infiniti Q45 and I enjoy driving this car more. I have read that people are complaining of throttle lag and indeed when I drove my friends 2007 ES 350 I noticed some lag. He used regular gasoline in his vehicle. With premium fuel I do not notice any lag. Mine is an 08, but I suspect the issue is type of fuel.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive! Beautiful Lexus interior. Nav system is a techno-junkies dream.</FAVORITE>
