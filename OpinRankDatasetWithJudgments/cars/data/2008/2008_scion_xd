<TEXT>The first time I saw this Barcelona Red Scion I loved it and it has proven to be a good purchase. I needed a reliable car to bomb about town and for short range (<500 miles) highway trips, although took did a 2000 mile trip and car preformed great. I also needed good cargo capacity and excellent gas mileage. It has proven itself on all counts. The red color is very easy to spot among all the silver cars in big parking lots. I also keep the rear seat down for hauling cargo; mostly golf clubs and groceries.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage: 34 city, 40 highway during summer drops to 30/36 during winter. Comfortable drivers seat. Lots of storage up front. Like the 6 step computer for watching MPG. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I loved this beast! Great performance, great handling, great ergonomics. I hauled my wife, two kids and a pop-up trailer all over. This is a great small- family. We sadly had to part ways as there is a third child coming soon, but if Scion would have built a stretched version (ala the Mazda5 we just traded for) we would have stayed in the Scion stable for a third run. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Goes anywhere, parks anywhere, a blast to drive, AWESOME gas mileage. We averaged 30 in mostly city drivings and 22 pulling a fully loaded camper and gear.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Fun car to drive</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have driven from GA to Key West and back, its a great car to drive in city but sure above average car in the Hwy.Road Handling is great and does not feel like a small car fear factor. I own a Maxima also and closely pay attention to the quality and overall performance. Recommend this for city zip zag. Many people compare this to Honda Fit, which I think is not the right comparison due the techinal specs to start with and also road drive pleasure in this is great. But what I wish Toyota can good better is the road noise, to compensate they have a great Pioneer system which is far better than Bose which I have in Maxima. Overall a strong buy recommendation. Good Luck,</TEXT>

<TEXT>I should be getting speeding tickets every time I drive it...I'm having tons of fun driving a stick again. On the freeway I'm doing 80 without realizing it. In the beginning gasoline would splash back out at every fill up. It took two visits to the same dealership to get the problem fixed. My description was not adequate so the second time the service manager hopped in and we went to a gas station and he saw it happen.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio controls on the steering wheel is my number one favorite feature. I got the optional armrest which enhances my comfort. Very happy with the optional cargo liner that my two dogs trample on. I also like the window closing feature when the key has already been taken out of the ignition.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had seen my first xD about a year before I bought mine. I was hooked from that point on. I looked at other cars- just to be sure-but always came back to the xD. Had to wait a few days to get my white manual, but it was worth it. I love driving it...it zips everywhere...and I love to brag about the gas mileage to my 'gas hog' driving friends.It is just too cute.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had my xD for about 18 months (33,000 miles) and love it. Depending upon how you drive, you'll meet or beat EPA. I drive on the slow side and have gotten 45 mpg highway more than a few times (yes 45!) even with family of 4 in the car. In summer, I regularly get 34-36 with mixed driving. The car is fun to drive and comfy for me (I'm only 5' 5" though). First car I ever bought new. No problems in 18 months. Tires still in good shape too. We test drove every car in this class (Nissan Versa, Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Kia Rio, Hyndai Accent, etc..) and felt that this was the best buy and ride for the money. Standard features can't be best. Highly recommend!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>IPod and Aux interfaces - work great! Onboard mileage computer. Seats in back lay down flat for nice big cargo area. Radio controls on steering wheel (standard). Standard side curtain air bags. Traction control (optional). Standard stereo is great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a lot of research and test drives, one year later I still stand by my purchase: It has the most features & style for the price. I drove this car cross-country packed with all of my valuables. The Honda Fit would not have had the power to merge with semis in the Colorado mountains at 75 mph while getting 40+ avg mpg. Thank the xD's Toyota 2ZR-FE Dual VVT-i 128hp engine. I bought this car to drive in LA, so the active head restraints, sideview mirror signals & the airbags for myself AND rear passengers were a major selling point. My friends love the interior design, stereo & comfortable seats too. Compared: Honda Fit Sport & Civic, Toyota Yaris Hatch & Sedan, Mini Cooper</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Scion XD for 7 months now and I love it. It is my first new and auto transmission. I live in the DC/Baltimore area and this car make commuting easy and comfortable. Fast pick up allows for easier merging onto highways. I had been looking into purchasing the XA, but am very happy I waited for the XD. It practically parks itself. After spending 9 years driving nothing but Manual, I am still getting used the the auto transmission. It is a wonderful car for those that love to save on gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Price was OK, but I might not buy it again. Screw went into tire sidewall in July 08, but no tire dealer had the odd ball size--took a week to order. Radio doesn't receive my favorite stations (90 Nissan did perfectly). Owners manual says to use only 0w-20 oil (or 5w-20), but Castrol won't sell it to consumers; my favorite auto shop doesn't buy it in bulk. Very noisy ride--so much so that dog doesn't like it. Doors seem to lock mysteriously, with no door key/lock on passenger side--have to go around. Dash gauges can be seen only by pushing button--not safe to do while driving--odometer should always be visible.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Estimated mpg matches sticker or better, and on highway, sometimes get 36 mpg. Seats fold flat--so did Honda Fit, my first choice, but the Fit did not come in white (deal breaker).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Long time Honda owner (no mas) change to Toyota/Scion and happy. Many Civics, Accords, CRV, never again. Anyway, I traded in the new to me 06 Xa which was a fantastic car, just wanted to upgrade and that is what I feel like the Xd is. I drive fast on the freeway and in traffic and this car is as stated, feels more substantial, less darty, more powerful. Inside the console is ergonomic, there are a lot more standard features and I am 5'10" 200 lbs and no problem with room. In short, I believe the Xd is a great replacement for the Xa and I really enjoyed my Xa, half of the miles where on the open highway, the other half in Phoenix, the city of bad drivers...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my xD for a little over a month now, and I absolutely LOVE IT! I feel like I am driving an SUV with out having the SUV car payment and poor fuel mileage. I am pulling about 32 city / 37 highway... YES!!! This little car has some power. It accelerates at a decent speed, and it keeps up the pace with minimal gas pedal pushing. And it is a solid car! Yeah it has a little road noise, but when you close the doors, you can hear how well made the car is. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm so happy I bought this car! I love it! It looks great and feels great and comes with so much fun stuff standard! I was thinking Honda Fit or Toyota Yaris, but when I saw the xD and took it for a ride, I was sold. Consumer Reports recommends the other two Scion models, and I'm sure after the xD is on the road for a while, they will also add it to their recommendation list.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the look and the feel of the vehicle. Also the roominess inside. Very classy interior. Sound system is nice. My son loves the Ipod port. I do mostly highway driving and I'm averaging a tad over 36 mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Next week, I will have had my Xd for 6 months and have seen only one other, so hence my choice of title. I traded an '01 Highlander and think this is a better vehicle when considering everything; styling, ride, comfort, gas mileage, etc. Also I think it is better than my '98 Landcruiser and my '95 4Runner, all things considered. I have had people quiz me about it and everyone loves it. Why doesn't Scion push this vehicle? When I tell people I have an Xd they assume it is an Xb. Nobody has heard of it. Also, Toyota is bringing out a vehicle called the Urban Cruiser, currently only for Europe. Guess What? It is a 4-wheel drive Xd! Buy this car---you'll love it</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking at hatchbacks for months as a commuter car. I wanted side curtain airbags, cruise control, and 30mpg or better. Compared to the Honda Fit- the seats aren't as comfy and the sport version (for cruise control) costs more. Nissan Versa- the back seats aren't as versatile (don't fold flat) Toyota Yaris- no cruise and not as much interior space Hyundai Accent-no cruise control Chevy Aveo- less power and no cruise control Volkswagen Rabbit- less mpg and more expensive Subaru Impreza - less mpg but a good 2nd choice Suzuki S- less mpg, lack of many dealerships nearby This was the best for the $ overall. It came with everything I wanted standard.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Scion xD for a week now and know I made the right choice. At 41 I'm cool again. I feel like a teenager again, this roomy little car is great. I love the style, love how it handles and plenty of power for a sub-compact. This is my 4th Toyota so I know it will last. The gas mileage is great and I can't believe how simple it was to buy the car. No Hassle and actually a pleasure. Crown Toyota in Ontario, CA. did a great job, thank you. It really is a fun car to drive. Very happy. GOOD JOB TOYOTA!!!...:) </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling, the dash layout is nice and the interior is sporty. The touches and design on the exterior are sharp. I like the exterior light configuration and the turn signals incorporated in the mirrors is cool. Plenty of power and great MPG!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2003 BMW 325i for the xd car. At first I didn't even think much about looking at the Scion brand because it is marketed to younger people and I am a middle age mom. With my BMW I became concerned about gas mileage and upkeep costs. When it was time to trade the car in I had my mind set on a Prius but after driving the Prius I happened to look over and see an xD. The salesman was reluctant but I insisted on driving the vehicle and loved it. When I saw that it gets only about 11 mpg less than the Prius with a $10K price difference I was sold. My kids call it the Wii car which is funny. Avg 42 hwy & 35 city. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Definitely high MPG for non hybrid car, good handling, easy to park in tight spaces, price and low cost maintenance, the stereo system outshines by BMW by far. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I use the car one week a month to drive 100 mi. a day, and the rest of the time it is a daily driver. On the week I drive my car pool to work there is me 6'0", step dad 5'11", mom 5'7" and coworker 6'3" and about 300 lbs. I have never had a shortage of power or room. For a car I can literally wrap my arms around that is saying a lot. The back seat that slides and reclines helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought the Scion xD last week, and I am so glad I didn't get a civic!! This car is much more stylish and sporty. My husband and I just moved to San Francisco and we quickly realized our '06 Accord was too large for much of the street parking around town. We did a lot of research and a lot of test driving before settling on the xD. The car has great handling and can tackle the city's hills with ease. We upgraded to leather, alloy wheels, and a moonroof from the dealer. This brought the price to just about what we would have paid for a fully loaded civic, but with much more of a "youthful" appearance. It is also great for my 70 mile a day commute to work. Great gas mileage!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty exterior and roomy interior. We get compliments from strangers around town all the time, everybody wants to know what it is. I love the availability of options from the dealer to give it a little more luxury. The iPod connection is awesome, one of the things I longed for in my accord. </FAVORITE>

The handling is great but it can use improvement, that is why i plan on improving it with official scion and trd parts.</TEXT>

<TEXT>50ish years old, we just bought a 08 Scion xD 1/2008, love it!! Fun to drive, comfortable, getting 31.5 mpg highway, 26 avg. city/hwy. We check mileage against fillups/hand calculating, and found the on board mileage computer was pretty accurate. Lots of leg room, could use maybe another inch of headroom (for me anyway). I'm 6'-3", over 300lbs (of pure muscle mind you!) & am quite comfortable in it though. The automatic, shifts smoothly into gear, digital display on dash also. Engine has plenty of power, undercarriage/engine noise is quiet except when passing etc. but not that big of a deal. Can get a undercoat like Ziebarts Sound Barrier for $179 to help deaden sound. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of power, handles real well on Interstate, did not get the VSC, not needed, we have good traction/control now in Jan weather. Definitely like the looks, roomy interior and cargo area. Get the Scion floor mat package, nice mats & rear bumper vinyl applique. Pioneer stereo is excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This Scion brings back good memories of my first Honda CRX. And it's just that, a memory. When Saab says that their cars were born from aircraft concepts, this Scion can claim the same--in spades. From the intelligence systems of the engine and brakes to the VSD option, this car screams ultra-high tech in all the right places. For all the standard features, this car is extravagant when considering the price and ownership costs to all of Europe's fragile models. From fit/finish/handling and roominess to a mild carbon footprint, the xD delivers like an F-14 Tomcat. This will become the old Beetle of our generation-- vintage classy with stealth technology.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quick and torquey but dampened ride in addition to super accurate steering. Quite roomy for below average sized individuals - perfect for 5'9" and under crowd. Anyway you slice it, a steal at pure pricing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall this is an excellent car. It's tiny on the outside (although it looks muscular) but it's really surprising how much room there is inside. Plenty of leg and head room in the front and back seats. This allows for a spirited drive and easy parking with plenty of comfort and utility. Nice compromise. Gas mileage is decent although I get better economy in my larger Corolla. The engine is nice and smooth with plenty of power, although it seems a little rough when first accelerating with the automatic. I expect amazing reliability, just like all Toyota's. Although it's nice to have the aux and iPod inputs on the stereo, the sound quality is poor. Not enough mids.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research, including going to the auto show to compare the competition - the Golf, the Versa, the Mini, the Yaris, and the Matrix. I was stunned when I found out almost everything comes standard on the car - it's a lot of car for the price, and it beat the competition by leaps and bounds! I also love how you sit high in the car while driving. It feels like driving a baby SUV. No buyer remorse here - this car is fantastic!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. With the xD, I am consistently getting 33 miles per gallon in a mix of city/highway driving. Good stuff! When I set out to purchase a new car, I wanted a four door hatch-back that would provide the ultimate in reliability and excellent gas mileage. I find the xD delivers these things and more. If one is considering a Honda Fit or a Nissan Versa, I would suggest that person take a serious look at the Scion xD. I considered the Honda and Nissan for months before stumbling across the xD by accident. I was blown away and made the decision to buy the Scion almost immediately. I have not regretted the purchase in the least!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am so disappointed with my xD. I researched countless vehicles until I decided on the xD. Bought it last week and it already has paint chips and scratches (and I don't drive in rough areas). In fact, upon closer inspection -- dirt combined with dew is actually what is causing the scratching, while I'm driving. Also has a small rust spot on the back. This car is only one week old!! Will be taking it back to the dealer tomorrow for inspection. Be warned!! I wish I stayed with Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just love my Scion xD! It is very comfortable to drive, handles well and the savings on gas is outstanding. I used to drive a Hyundai Santa Fe and while I loved that car as well, the gas costs were starting to get old. The knowledge that it is a Toyota product was also a deciding factor. I went into the dealership with the intent purpose of buying a Toyota and when I compared the "standard" options of the Matrix against those of the xD, it was no contest. Not to mention the price which was a lot less for the xD.</TEXT>

Excellent interior design, clever dash, gets looks from other drivers. Will be using for work travel instead of my 2500 HD Duramax diesel, my gas savings will equal my new xD payment!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My last car was the xA and I was totally happy with it. When I first heard the xA would be replaced, I was really annoyed. But then I test drove the xD and I was sold on it immediately. It's a definite upgrade. I love the xD's power, and it feels safer to me. I drive a lot of highways on my daily commute. It's a great feeling that can keep up with everyone else on the road and do it safely. My only wish is 16" alloy wheels. Will they ever be available?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went to look for a new car. Open minded and looked at a number of different ones and test drove more than I probably should. I saw a nice custom jeep, looked at a number of new BMWs then I saw it from across the lot: the new Scion xD. Nice looking, great features, 100s of accessories, great gas mileage, great warranty, etc. The list just went on and on. Then I drove and immediately fell in love. My partner kept pushing the BMW, which was really nice and I was about to get it but, I liked the Scion. I would recommend this car as well as the other Scion models to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is overall a great car to have. It gets good fuel economy, and has enough pick-up to get up to speed on the highway. The small design allows this car to be navigated through the tightest of spaces, while the height that you ride at almost makes you feel like you are riding in a SUV or a crossover. You do get looks driving in this car, I had a guy in an Acura looking up and down the side of it trying to figure out what I was driving! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my eyes on this car for the past 3 month, I bought it home with me to many oohhhhs and aaaaahhhh from my family member. When you lay eyes on the Scion from the outside it is TINY, but when you step in it's like magic the inter room is amazing! It felt like I was driving a minivan! Everything is perfect on the car. The only, and I mean the only, complaint is that there is no armrest in the front. Since I bought the car I have been looking for excuses to run errands and go to work, just anything that will let me drive the car. It is an amazing car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have really enjoyed driving this car. The driver's seat couldn't be more comfortable. I have plenty of leg room and the trunk space will hold more than you think. I like to call this car my TARDIS since it seems so big on the inside, but looks so small from the outside. It gets lots of looks and people ask me about it all the time. I had a Corolla with 196000 miles on it and my wife has a Matrix. I was going in to buy a new Corolla, but was considering a Matrix too when the xD caught my eye.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Scion has everything done right, from the interactive website where you can build your vehicle, the pure pricing so you know what you're getting, to the buying experience where you pick the transmission, whether to have VSC or not, and then a list of dealer added options. Then when you get the car, everything is intuitively in the right place, and you don't even have to read the manual, since you can go to the website and watch the instructional videos. The xD is cute, spunky, has a lot of pep, and feels solid for such a small car. It's spacious enough for four adults, and very economical on the gas. It was made for Japanese domestic market so it slips into and out of traffic easily.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The iPod connector. You can use the dial to scroll through playlists, songs, and the titles of the artist and songs are displayed for you. The steering mounted audio controls are nice also. The huge list of standard features. Thoughtful interior design, cool pugnacious exterior, a little bulldog.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>All cars should be fun to drive, easy on gas, accommodate my iPod and have airbags all around. The Scion xD is a great value when you shop it against the main competitors here on Edmunds. Just be sure to add all the extras to the other cars because the Scion xD gives us a lot for our money. If it does as well as the xA the dealer says it will be in the top 10 for resale value. And that is for ALL passenger cars. Toyota makes it. The dealers sell it without hassling you or lying, and people love it everywhere we go. If you're looking for a great car for not a lot of money, you should check the xD out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'll admit it. I didn't want to look inside this vehicle. However, I bought one. I started by looking at small, affordable econosized cars. I test drove Mazda3 hatchback, Honda Fit and Civic, Toyota Yaris, Corolla (CE, LE, SE) and Matrix. Scion xD offers a smooth ride that picks up nicely and gets you to where you need to go. It's a true city car. Small, compact, affordable and gas economical. Excellent gas ratings (>35mpg), is comfortable in the inside, and is extremely user-friendly. The seats fold down flat in the back. It can haul a ton of stuff; or seat 5 (normal weight) persons very comfortably. Car feels "euro" designed. It's an urbanized car that can get around a city easily.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard power doors/windows, cruise control, music/vol controls on steering wheel.

I have never smiled during a test drive, but the xD just is fun! I couldn't help it. The standard upgrades like great stereo and iPod hook ups are really great. The get up and go power is much better than the other vehicles that I compared it with. Also the interior room is much more spacious. I wasn't really fond of the interior black color at first, but I have really come to like it. The standard safety features are really nice too. Also, the pure price deal makes the buying process so much easier! I love my scion!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my xD for a long commute - I drive 1000 miles a week on average. My gas mileage is consistently 35+ mpg on the highway, 32-34 overall. It's a little noisy, but responsive and smooth. It's cute as anything; people are always turning to check out my car! I've never owned a hip car before. A little more cargo space would be nice. The stereo controls are great, and I love that cruise control comes standard. I wish the fuel gauge was a little more attention-getting. Sometimes I don't notice that I'm low on gas until it's been flashing for a while; it's not very bright. I actually ran out of gas on my first tank... then again, I should pay more attention!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was torn between the Scion xD and the Honda Fit. I am glad I got the Scion xD. I like being higher up and the xD feels like a more solid car. All the cars were coming with the upgraded radio, but don't be fooled into buying something you don't want. It was easy and quick to order it my way and have the regular radio put in at the arrival port in Jacksonville. That $389 will pay for my window tinting. The only extras I ordered were the electronic stability control & floor/cargo mats. Every other thing I wanted was included in the basic model. It is a fun car and easy to drive and park. I drove a Chevy Cavalier for 22 years and now am a Scion fan. Great value for the money. </TEXT>

It's higher up than you might expect, feels like an SUV on the road. Great on hilly terrain. Everything about it is nice. It has better lines than the Caliber, the Fit, or other Toyotas.

<TEXT>My initial opinion of the car was that it looked so small. Once I opened the door and got inside, however, I was shocked! The interior is not only spacious but incredibly well laid out. I'm six feet tall and fit easily into the seats with ample head room to spare. The controls were especially well designed and the overall feel of the dash was that it was designed with purpose and care. Comparable models and brands often just throw a slab of plastic on and a few radio knobs and call it a dash but Scion thoughtfully put together a great interior for its owners.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>iPod hookup which allows you to play, charge, and control your iPod right from the stereo itself. No more reaching down and dangerously changing songs while driving!

<TEXT>I just bought my xD two days ago and I haven't even learned how to use 90% of the features and can't really rate it on reliabity, fuel consumption, etc., yet. It's fun to drive and extremely potent for its size. Leg room isn't important to me since I'm 5'2. I really fell in love with it's design.

I downsized from an Acura TSX and while the xD isn't the same type of car, I actually prefer it when you factor in its affordability. It has enough pick-up to merge on I-95 when it is moving and keep up once you are on. I am 6'3" and I can sit comfortably in the backseat with the driver's seat adjusted back. I also drove the Fit Sport, and the xD feels like a much more substantial car and has much better pick-up on the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It was between the Scion xD and the Honda Fit. I test drove the fit and then the xD and there was no decision to be made - the xD easily. The cars are comparable, except the engine. You can really feel the xD's power compared to the Fit, and it makes the Fit feel cheap. The only 2 issues with the xD: 1) The cabin ride is not very quiet. If you like a silent ride, this is NOT the car for you. 2) No arm rest. I have a stick, so this isn't so much of an issue. But if I had an auto, this would drive me insane.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smaller size so I can fit anywhere. Yet, the inside is quite roomy, even in the back. The seats are also comfy. Nice list of standard safety features was a plus. Bigger engine than other cars in the same class. For me, the combined speedometer/tachometer is easier to read than two separate meters.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased. Where else can you get a fully loaded automatic for under 16K? Plus the Toyota reliability factor and excellent gas mileage (27-32 mpg under the more strict 2008 EPA standards). The ride is very nice. Handling is tight and the xD's engine is more than adequate (128hp 4 cyl). In comparison, the Honda Fit (109hp) and Toyota Yaris (106 hp) don't come close. There's plenty of passenger room in the interior and the 60/40 split rear seats fold flat for plenty of cargo space. The standard 160-watt Pioneer stereo system with 6 speakers sounds great.The Scion xD offers the little intangibles that you just cannot find in any car in its class.You can't go wrong with the Scion xD.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The xD has a dedicated iPod adapter that you can control on the stereo face. Fuel economy is excellent. I got 36 mpg on my first tank of gas. The xD has a digital display that tracks your mileage. It resets every time you fill up. Love the safety features (6 air bags and ABS), price. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife bought this monday. Over all it is not a bad car but dealing with Scion dealers left a bad taste in our mouth. Scion likes to claim they have a "Pure Price" that is set by Scion but the dealers pile on doc fees and every other fee you can think of. But that is enough about the horrible dealers and lets talk about the xD. The car itself is very small. It is basicly a four door toyota yaris but it does have side airbags standard and in this car you will need them in a T bone crash. My wife thought the ride of the car was ok but to me it felt just like the old scion xA which was bumpy and cheap feeling. The car has about 23 more hp than the xA but on the road you cannot feel it.</TEXT>

Very roomy inside for it's size. It will surprise you in that respect. The 5 speed manual shifts easy. The clutch is a bit tight and requires a few higher revs then my Cobalt did to get moving, but this is an engine that welcomes higher revs. I'm very glad I chose the xD for my next car.

<TEXT>I wanted Ford escape hybrid. Husband wanted this trinket car. This car is easy to maintain. It has all kinds of dummy alarms to say "hey stupid u left the lights on or change your oil" etc. One of the best thing is this car is higher of the ground. You don't get stuck in the snow ( I did w/ civic always) with it and my 6'3" husband can fit in it. I have hip problems. I have no problem get in and out. We packed for our trip and my husband had all this luggage. I thought I got him now! Your not going to be able to put all that and the dog crate in that trinket of a car. Wrong, it was no problem. It has a lot of storage, pioneer radio, I-pod hook up. We went on a 7 hr trip and got 44/g at65. Xd hybrid next? </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased our XD after looking at similar products. Our biggest reason for purchasing was for reliability and resale value (as we may not hold it for too long). Gas mileage was a consideration as well. I consistently gets 28-30 both highway and city. Even all highway was only 30 which was a little disappointing. My wife's only real complaint in the comfort of the seats for her (she is shorter). The ride is nice. It sits higher than our 2000 altima which is very nice and the higher body doesn't drag the bumper on our driveway (we live in Pittsburgh w/ lots of hills). Overall, we feel like it was a good purchase, but w/ our 1st baby on the way it won't be long before we need more room. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car along with my trade in of a '93 Honda Civic. I researched similar cars of this type and budget including the Honda Fit, Nissan Versa, Toyota Yaris and Honda Civic. It was a final contest between the xD and the Civic but I found out that Scion is Toyota and the xD uses the same 2ZR-FE engine as in her more expensive cousin, Toyota Corolla. The fact that my last Civic died on me at a red light in a crime infested neighborhood during after hours tells me much about Honda's true reliability.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for something inexpensive, reliable, and stylish; I'd pretty much had my heart set on the scion tc, but I had hesitations about getting a 2 door, so I got the xd instead. This car is ok, but I have a few somewhat major gripes. There are HUGE blind spots on either side near the rear windows [& a tiny back window], so when I want to change lanes, I feel like I'm taking a risk even with turning my head to look and using my mirrors. The brake system is weird, and even though it's supposed to respond to a 'light tap', I have to press pretty hard to get the car to stop, and it's a very bumpy ride (even going over parking lot speed bumps feels like off-roading in rough terrain).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power locks and windows, keyless entry. Excellent gas mileage. Compact - can park it anywhere. About 5 billion cupholders! Fold down rear seats. Good steering/handling. Stylish for such a small car. Comfy seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Such a great little car...especially for the price. The gas mileage is fantastic. After 5K miles I have consistently averaged 36+ MPG with combined in city hwy/street driving. Highway mileage alone has come in as high as 42MPG. This car is fun, easy to drive-turn-park and fits me perfectly. My hubby 6' 3" hubby purchased an XB and I fell in love with it with one exception...it's just TOO big inside. I found myself having to reach too far for everything. But the XD has everything at perfect arms length. And the clutch is light and the manual trani is easy to shift. The only negative is that at 5K it has more "little noises" than I would have expected from a Toyota product.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this little gem after having driven a '99 Windstar for almost 10 years. It took a little getting used to the change in size, but overall, this has been a great choice in vehicle! I mostly drive in town, but occasionally get on the highway. I find I get decent mileage in town and excellent mileage on the open road. The car defies the laws of physics. It is very comfortable for even large people and can hold a LOT more cargo than it looks. I love how I can whip in and out of parking spots easily, or slip into the next lane of traffic without cutting off the guy behind me. Overall, it's been a great car to drive and the money I save on gasoline is a dream!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having been driving a 1995 Honda Civic CX Hatchback for the last 10 Years, this was definitely different! After studying Hondas and Toyotas I had it in my mind to either buy a Corola or a Civic (Both have exceptional Engines that last for quite a long time!). Determined to go to the Honda dealership and the Toyota dealership before I actually buy. My first stop was at the Toyota dealership. After the salesman showed me a few corolas on sale then he showed me a Scion XD. Having no idea about Scions (At the time I didn't know they were toyotas, I just thought they were another cheap brand), he explained in detail about the scion brand. After test driving the Scion and Corola, I bought the XD.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the Hatch back and room, my Honda was a hatchback and I actually marveled on how much stuff I could actually haul in it! Good handling and good enough power for a car that gets about 30+ MPG. Love all the extras (Power locks, windows, AC, etc), remember, my last car had manual everything!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this guy a couple of months ago as an all-around hauler. I drive about 75 miles a day for work, was looking for practicality and fun. Also use on weekends for trips to see our daughter at college, etc. Very pleased with the xD. Lowered with TRD springs from dealer, rear spoiler, bumper protector. Have not used for overnight trip, but hauls four adults with ease (we are all short) and occasionally five for trips around town. Looked also at the Honda Fit, also nice, but glad I chose the xD. 33-36 miles per gallon (measured at fill-ups), 35-39 average on readout. Ride (w/TRD springs) is firm but comfortable. Co-worker has an xD also and has had good experience, highly recommended!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Came with everything needed, power windows, door locks, cruise. Great features and handling for 'economy car.'</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the xD in March 2008, and have six months experience driving it. Fuel economy has been a steady 34 mpg, calculated. I have had only one incident where the Vehicle Stabilization Control system automatically worked its magic. It was during a highway run, climbing a hill during a rainstorm when traction was especially bad. The system kicked in at a time when I was unaware that I was losing traction. I maintained control with its aid, slowed down,and carried on with my trip all smoothly, safely done. This VSC is a worthwhile feature. One slight but nagging shortfall in the design of this car is the FEEL of the brakes-- they operate well, but are vague in their feel.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The features themselves, their number and convenience. This is a nice package for the price, a wonderful small car. I like its homely looks, too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I was first looking at cars to buy I was trying to find an SUV. I wanted a vehicle that I could put stuff in the back of (home depot trips, etc.). Unfortunately, gas shot up to like $4 a gallon that day so I got rid of the SUV idea. After a lot of researching and reviewing, i went with the xD for its gas mileage, fold- down back seats (my friend and I can finagle our mountain bikes in there and trips to home depot are no problem), a low price tag, and the Toyota built engine. I've had the car about 6 months now and i couldn't be happier. It's definitely got some pep to it when you hit the gas, too. Good for light stuff, just don't expect to do any heavy hauling. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold-down back seats, gas mileage, reliable, ballsy for a small car, lots of cup holders!, and lots of options to customize it when you buy it and a hell of a lot of aftermarket parts. Oh and it's got a good amount of space: I'm 6', 245 lbs and I feel really comfortable driving it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall I am completely satisfied with my Scion xD. I purchased a 2008 xD in May 2008 because I commute 140 miles round trip. The xD has all the air bags, ABS and cruise control standard unlike some other small cars I looked at (Toyota Yaris, Honda Fit). My commute is half open freeway and half stop and go freeway. My fuel efficiency averages 35 MPG during the summer with the AC on all the time. I expect it to go up in the fall and winter. The xD is comfortable although the seats could be a little cushier. I think the gauges are well placed. Not having an arm rest doesn't bother me. Main drawback is blocking the sun from the door window. The sun visor doesn't have an extension.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Odometer features, average MPG and miles left on this tank of gas are my favorites Stereo controls on steering wheel cruise control lots of cup holders and storage cubbies Good air flow vents</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was my wife's first new car. We bought it because of the look, the navigation system, but mostly because of the "expected" great fuel economy. I don't have much to say about the design besides that there should be an arm rest and it is crazy that the nav system doesn't allow you to use some of the options when the car is moving. The only real disappointment is the gas mileage. I read many reviews that stated 30+ and much more on trips. We have never seen anything better than 26-27/gallon city or highway or some combination. I know it's not way off, but I was planning to see better than what we are getting.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car in February 08 when we sold our Xterra. Already own a 06 corolla, and like Toyotas. This car is zippy, good gas mileage (31 city, 33+ hwy) and looks great. Standard power everything, cruise, you name it! The safety features are all standard- side, seat and front air bags. Good thing, too. A guy in a stolen car ran me off the road and into the concrete median in the middle of the hwy going about 65 mph, and I walked away with a sprained wrists and burns/scrapes from the seat belt and airbags. The car didn't make it, but it did it's job. Loved that little car and will miss it, but thankful for the fun it gave me and the life it saved!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I debated which to buy, the Honda Fit or the Scion XD. I decided that I liked the body style better with the XD, I also liked the larger wheels which came standard on the XD (16" as opposed to the Honda Fit 14"). I am so happy with the XD. I drive 150 miles a day to/from work so I log a lot of miles quickly. I am now up to 11,800 miles and have not had a problem. It is comfortable and roomy for 4 adults. We recently took it from Ann Arbor to Chicago for a soccer tournament and had plenty of room for all four adults, we just made sure to pack lightly as there is not a lot of room for numerous suitcases but then again that is not what I bought it for. I highly recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to get a car that is good on miles, reliable (I was only looking for a Japanese car), and safe. I've researched so many cars for a few months and it was b/w Civic or Xd. I decided to buy Xd bc of its long list of standard options for this price, and was pretty much in love when I test drove one- it zips very well, inside is roomy, and I actually like its cute looks! I've only put 200 miles on, and still have a half gas tank! I got close to 42 miles on highway, and I'm getting about 31.5 miles in a city drive, with A/C on most of the time(the weakest level though). I'll get 18 inch wheels that makes the car look a lot better. I would buy one again, I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Gas Gas Gas! What can I say that would make a person downgrade/upgrade from a souped up 89 Toyota Supra (Vroom! problem child gas sucka)~ tricked out/ supped up 04 PT Cruiser Turbo (Ehh.. but still gas sucka!) ~ to a 08 almost tricked out but not there yet Scion XD. Moving from the Bay area to Virginia I honestly did not think I would ever trade in my PT but after experiencing the WORST commuter traffic in the USA, and VA to DC eats the cake over Marin County to Alameda County, I had to ditch the PT..=(. I test drove the Fit, Yaris, and Corolla before the XD. But the XD won in the end for gas as well as over all styling. </TEXT>

I just got it last week and have put 200 miles on and still have a half gas tank!My average MPG is 31-32, and I got almost 42 on highway!I cant wait to stretch this car out- a full tank of gas keeps this car running for 350-400 miles I reckon, which is great! I love the audio control, it lets you concentrating your eyes on traffic! I will get 18 inch wheels sometimes it makes this car look more luxury, check the parts online though it can be done cheaper.

<TEXT>I had to go looking for another car after i was in a car accident in my former scion xA (hydroplaned at 60 mph, hit a guardrail and flipped over, yet walked away without a scratch), so i wanted another car that was safe, and reliable, and still had great gas mileage. well the xD was the perfect car for driving and style. It's different and you almost never see another one on the road, i average 37- 40 mpg depending on where I'm driving, it's extremely easy to move in and out of traffic due to its small design, and its extremely safe crash test ratings and standard side airbags set my mind at ease. I will be keeping this car for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just traded in our gas guzzling minivan for this cute little car and what a great decision it was. The dealership did not budge on the $15,700 sticker price for the base model (which was loaded - no complaints there) with the manual transmission but it was still a fabulous price. We are averaging 38 combined city/hwy mph and a whopping 41 mpg on the highway. No more filling up at $102 a pop. This car sips! We love the ride and there is plenty of room for the kids in the back. Only downfall is that darn arm rest - a driver and passenger one would be nice. Other than that, this is a great car for the money and we highly recommend it. Can't wait to drive it in the snow.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2005 Ford Escape two and a half months ago for my new xD. The gas mileage is great, I drive about 10 miles every day (back and forth to work) and still never get below 32 mpg. On long trips I get close to 40 if not more. I love the styling, performance, stereo, everything. I researched many other cars, looking for better gas mileage than what I was getting. I settled on the xD due to overall value and standard list of features. I went from driving an auto to manual and it hasn't bothered me at all and I had no problem adjusting to the gauges. The only thing extra I got were floor mats. I love my new xD and couldn't be happier!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the hip modern styling. This car appears has more interior room than its outside size would allow. It is easy to park and is loads of fun to drive. The car does have a blind spot that takes getting used to. I drove a Honda Fit before purchasing my Scion XD and other than the gas mileage I have no regrets with my purchase. I recommend this car to anyone that needs a dependable well built car with great resale value. I also considered the Smart car. But after its initial reviews would much rather own a Scion XD.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wifey and I owned a 2002 Envoy before buying our Xd. We got it with black 18 inch wheels, rear spoiler, mats, chrome decoration and the blingy interior lights. Got hosed on our trade, but doesn't everyone with an SUV today. Went from putting $70 a week in gas to $35 every 2 weeks. Maiden voyage was 1200 miles round trip from Ct. to southern Virginia. Highway average was 38 mpg. After coming home, we get 30 mpg in all around driving. That's with a straight gear, light foot and hyper-mile-ing. A very comfortable car(we drove 10 hrs), power is a little short, but past 3500 rpm and it zips real nicely. We drove the Civic and I really liked it. But, I liked the hatchback and the Fit was just boring</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is great. Mileage superb. We bought red because I don't consider silver, black or white actual colors. That leaves red or blue. The blue is close to black. 5 speed works smoothly, got used to the gauge setup. Gets lots of compliments.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the Scion xD after driving the xA from an ebay sale, downsizing from a pickup truck which i can no longer afford to drive. After two weeks of both highway and around town driving, I find the xD to be fun to drive,comfortable and very economical (35+ combined mpg.) Although you won't win any drag races in a Scion, it will zoom up to highway speeds quickly enough where it floats effortlessly at 75+ mph. Handling and cornering are excellent and the seats are firm and supportive. In spite of its size the xD drives like a larger vehicle. Fold the seats down and there's plenty of room for your stuff. It was a great choice. I'm going to keep it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With gas at $4 a gallon, I researched several higher-mileage cars including the Toyota Yaris, Nissan Versa, Honda Fit, and the Scion XD. I chose the Scion even though it didn't have the highest MPG ratings, but it did come with far more standard amenities and just as many safety features as the others. To add all of the standard XD features to the Yaris, Versa or Fit, and you'd bump their prices higher than the base XD. In addition to the great mileage (I'm averaging about 33 MPG in mixed- conditions, driving 50 miles a day), it has 128 HP which gets me in and out of traffic quickly. I'm 5'11, 200 lbs, and there's plenty of head, leg and hip room. I highly recommend the XD!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Two months into ownership and we are extremely pleased with the xD. We wanted something that would replace our Toyota Tacoma, which had given us wonderful reliability for 110,000 miles but the 23 mpg was killing me when I drove it for work (my cheap employer who still thinks gas costs $1.20 a gallon pays only 20 cents per mile). I drove the Yaris 4 dr and liked it very much but did not like the auto transmission and the lack of a hatchback. The Scion was just the ticket, exactly what I wanted. I rode the fence between this and the Fit, but I like the bigger tires and higher ride on this and the great stereo system. Best of all is the gas mileage. 44mp on the freeway!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>44 MPG on the Interstate. That's driving 55 mph, not 70, at which point it drops to around 38 mph.

We've got a 11 month old son and it fits his stroller, play yard and a duffel bag for long trips. The only critique I have is that I am 6' 2" tall and on long trips, the car isn't the most comfortable. It's snug in the back seat when I sit next to my son's car seat, but other than that it drives like a dream, turns on a dime and is a great buy!! Will definitely purchase Scion again!!</TEXT>

The xD is very responsive and well powered in spite of its economy. It reminds me a bit like a "Go Kart" the way it handles turns. On long trips she is very comfortable and the standard stereo is high quality. MPG is in the mid 30's which is great for such a peppy car. Only negative is that the mirror buttons and dimmer controls are not illuminated at night. No big deal but it would be nice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you're looking to save gas - look no further. I've had this car since last October. Overall mileage is in the mid 30's. Three recent trips at 55 mph on highway netted 46 mpg. (that's true mpg - not computer) One was with 4 people in the car. Going to & from work (mix of highway and city) has been about 37 mpg. I test drove everything in this type (Nissan Versa, Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Kia Rio 5, etc...), felt this was easily the best of hte bunch. Can't understand Consumer Report's love affair with the Honda Fit - rode like a 70's Ford Pinto. We recently took a trip to Branson with our family of 4 and did well - a little tight for luggage but it worked. Really love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2004 4 runner due to fuel costs. Looked at the matrix but couldn't figure out what we were actually getting for the cost. My wife test drove both and loved the Xd. The test drive combined with all the standard options and the price of the Xd made it a no brainer for us over the matrix. We enjoy driving it, its no sports car but the power to MPG factor is better than expected. At 6 feet tall, I find it just a bit short on leg room but overall very comfortable. The bottom line is that for a great price we have a highly fuel efficient vehicle that looks good, is fun to drive, and loaded with creature comforts. Hated to give up the 4 runner but love what we got in return.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Price-feeling like we really got something for the money. MPG-- we can get 34 or better with the AC on and at top interstate speeds.

<TEXT>After test driving the Yaris and Honda Fit, the peppy engine, higher seating, amazing standard safety features and overall appearance sold me on the xD. My only real complaint is the road noise, but that's of pretty minor importance to me. It's a tight little, precise ride and the manufacturing tolerances are really impressive. Everything feels like quality on the Scion, unlike with the Ford Focus that it's replacing. I also love the firmness of the seats. The toggle feature on the l.e.d. odometer which allows you to see your mpg at any current moment is really nifty (although I'm a little suspicious of the accuracy of such a device). At any rate, this is an exciting little car.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Love My Scion XD</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I purchased my 2008 Scion Xd a week ago and I am enjoying my drive. It is a fun car to drive and I look forward to driving it every day. It is a little noisy but the standard features outweigh the road noise. I test drove the Honda Fit, the Nissan Versa and the Honda Civic before test driving the Scion Xd and when I did I knew I had found the car. It was fun to drive and all the standard features. The gas mileage is what they say 26 city avg. and 32 hwy miles. I mainly drive city miles. I do wish it had a center armrest. Wished the VSC would come standard but other than that I love my Scion in red. Enjoy when I see turned heads as I drive by. I love it's uniqueness in looks. Love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The upgraded stereo system, cruise control, keyless entry, ipod connector,low tire warning light, MPG.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this XD with the auto trans, that was the first mistake. This thing scares the heck our of me while trying to merge into 70 mph traffic. Road noise is excessive and the ride is rather bumpy. The brakes are adequate but spongy. Highway mpg is not too bad at 38 but local driving is a dismal 23 mpg. Rear passenger space is surprisingly adequate for average sized people. Rear storage space is small but this a sub compact and is to be expected. The hubcaps had to go. I bought 7 spoke wheels that look much better. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Options such as power windows, keyless entry and cruise control standard. Trip and mileage computer. Larger wheels than others in class. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have my XD for only 3 weeks now that?s not a long time but it took me 6 months to decided on a car and boy was it the right one. It?s not a car for everyone but you have to judge your needs and figure out what?s best for you. The XD has everything I needed power on everything but the seat. ipod connection, decent power for the car it is. Looks cool and with the addition of some aftermarket products it will look great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If your looking for a subcompact that is dependable,well built, good on gas and different, then buy this car. This is the second Scion in my family and I can tell you these cars are great deals. Get in and test drive one and see for yourself. If you want 36+ miles a gallon,all the options at one price, and a cool car to boot then buy an XD.</TEXT>

I traded in my 05 civic for it, I think it has better pickup than the civic, Has a lot a neat features inside, like Ipod jack and mp3 player jack, The mpg is Ok, not as good as the civic but I think it is fun to drive. I like how it sets up higher kind of like a small suv with a lot better mpg</TEXT>

<TEXT>We chose the Scion xD for the obvious reasons, gas mileage and bang for the buck. The car has an ugly dog sort of cuteness to it. Our initial impression is that it is a great little car. You definitely get what they advertise. If you want a Lexus level of performance, quiet and ride quality, don't buy this car. If you want an inexpensive, feature heavy car, this is the one you want! The "Pure Price" concept makes buying cars a snap. No pressure, no negotiating - what you see is what you get.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Gas mileage not what was promised. I'm only getting 22.3 MPG mostly city with some highway. My old 6 cyl Mercedes got similar! The dash board rattles, sounds like there's a hornet in the car. Lots of blind spots, the rear window is like a porthole; the wide front struts and bulky side mirrors completely obscure pedestrians in crosswalks and vehicles approaching on the right. Visibility is so poor, I don't think I'll be keeping the car. Wish I'd gotten the Honda Fit. Too bad, Scion. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is cute. I like the styling, interior features and details like the radio controls on the steering wheel. Plenty of leg room, rear seats flatten to allow lots of storage; seats are comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the car for gas mileage and ability to still haul a few things, and that's exactly what I got. It goes down the highway fine, and of course is good around town. The standard accessories are nice because it's most of the things you'd "add" anyhow. Disappointed in no center arm rest as a standard option, and the "XM Ready" radio is about as ready as any radio is. It cost $500 more dollars to make it ready, which is very deceiving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were in the market for a small, affordable car with decent space and high mpg. The xD price tag impressed us but when you add in all of the features that are included with the price such as the functionality of the interior (sliding and folding rear seats), the electronics (trip computer, cruise, great stereo with steering wheel controls and aux/iPod inputs), and the solid handling and engine, the car is a huge bargain. It really feels substantial on the road and the power is much better than expected. It's actually fun to drive and doesn't look like every other car out there! The gas mileage is excellent so far. The xD may very well become our car for long trips now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up the Xd last month after the rising price in gas was making it impossible for me to keep my old vehicle. Went from a Nissan Titan to the Xd and I couldn't be happier. It's so fun to drive. Very sporty and nimble. Lots of get up and go for such a small engine. I was pleasantly surprised at how much room it has inside too. I'm 6'2" and fit in it with no problems at all. When I first purchased it, all I could think about was how much I was going to miss driving my truck. Now, much to my surprise, I enjoy driving the Scion more than I did my Titan. And the mileage is great. So far the lowest tank I've had has been 35 MPG and I have a tendency to keep my foot in it a lot. Very pleased. </TEXT>

The Xd is a lot better than the Honda fit, more options, better ride, better price. I would highly recommend this car. Excellent gas mileage, Toyota "SCION" cannot be beat...</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased this car last month for a gas saver (Previous vehicle a 2002 Chevrolet Silverado ext. cab) -- Skeptic at first, however I was wrong! This car is not only very good on gas, but it shows quality at every turn. From a guys point of view I must admit I have ended up being the prominent driver (no regrets). Toyota has really landed a nice concept of "a lot of car for your money". It is no wonder that they (Toyota) have secured the title of the number 1 auto manufacturer in the world. Domestic auto makers should take not. Bottom line for those considering... "Economical doesn't mean cheap!" (or boring) </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded an o7 Camry that was paid for, at 18,000 miles, and another year on the 36,000 mile warranty for the Scion xD. The Camry was a sweet ride, and it had all the bells, and whistles, but the gas mileage was nada. I'm still shaking just thinking about it, however it cost me no out of pocket money. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I drove the xD home, and the first big truck that came by did not blow me off the road, I hardly felt it. I still have over half tank of gas, at 193 miles. I had two choices, I could look at the Camry in the drive way or I could ride the xD all over the place. Gas in not going down, and I made the adjustment. I'm glad I did it. I like to ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It looks better than the other subcompacts. A stable car, good around large trucks. Keyless entry, power windows, and doors, cruise, rear defroster, standard equipment is excellent. Love the gas mileage, and cute too. I feel like a cool grandma at 60. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>A Scion named Sveta.</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I recently got rid of my 12 MPG gas guzzler. I wanted a small car for banging around Boston, running errands, and road trips. I purchased a 2008 Scion XD with every bell and whistle available. After owning it for two weeks, I took it on a road trip from Boston to Upstate NY (600 miles round trip). On the first 300 miles, I got 42 mpg with my manual transmission. I traveled secondary highways through New Hampshire and Vermont, where the speed limit was @ 55 mph. The return trip averaged 40.5 mpg. My daily commute (a whopping 2.5 miles) scores @ 36 mpg. This car is an amazing gas sipper!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage, interior room - I am 6 foot 6, and I fit comfortably. Someone can actually sit behind me! Also, I got the nav system - goodbye maps - a 'must have' technology from now on. The car handles great, and feels quite peppy in traffic. It is a great car at a great price, full of features.</FAVORITE>

Standard features on the Scion were extras on the other cars we looked at. It drives like a big car, every time I get out of it, I look at it and can't believe how small it is! The Pioneer stereo/cd are great. Can't go wrong with Toyota. 42 mpg highway so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a Toyota Yaris for about two years and finally one day decided to turn it in, and have never been happier. I got a silver, automatic Xd with a few upgrades. The minute I test drove it I knew I had to have one. I like Toyota, but the handling isn't as sturdy as a Scion. Even the case the owners manual is more classy than Toyota's. I am only 20, and it's great to know that I can get such an excellent car for a price that I can afford. Also, being an environmentally conscious consumer, this vehicle allows me to be green and have a sense of style. Excellent job, Scion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got the car almost a month ago, and so far so good. Gas mileage is amazing, although I find interior space and legroom a little small. But it's not bad considering I'm a big fella. I understand that I had to give up some of the spaciousness of my prior car (98 jeep g.c) to enjoy the superb mileage. Handling seems a little mushy around corners on the highway, and I think eventually I'll add the TRD rear sway bar, which is supposed to improve handling tremendously. The car is very versatile with the folding/reclining rear seats, and is perfect for a car seat. Easy to get the kids in and out. A fit driver told me he wishes he got the xd, since the Fit can barely get out of it's own way.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>rear hatch opens easily, stereo, smooth shifting 5 speed, great for kids. people love the looks, mine is super white. wonderful new car smell. car is very peppy, 3rd gear really cooks. neat accessories available, i got the rear bumper protector. very high quality build. made in japan, total quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been driving a Honda Civic hatchback for the last 10 years, before buying this car. I chose the xD after doing research on current small cars. This car surprised me in a few ways : 
1) the high value-to- cost ratio 
2) the very different look of the car (pleasing, to me) 
3) the excellent gas mileage ratings and 
4) the obvious commitment by Toyota to "getting it right". 
I might have purchased an xA if it had been available this year, but not after driving the xD ! I think Toyota has gotten it right with this package. My wife was enthusiastic enough to purchase an xB the following month.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>None of my previous cars had an automatic transmission. Auto was one of the features that caused me to buy a new car. Size was another. I just like small cars. I'm still not sure how they engineered so much interior room in this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car after researching most of the models in this size. Three things sold me: 1) Long list of standard features, 2) It is a Toyota, 3) Great looking. The only option that I purchased was the floor-mats. So far I am getting 30 mpg back and forth to work and 39 mpg on trips. My family of four takes this car everywhere. There is plenty of leg room all around and it is very comfortable to drive and ride in. We are actually considering replacing my wife's car with an xD. We also like that it feels a bit like driving a sports car. The dealer experience was great with Scion's Pure Price. Finally seeing other xDs on the road, but now I am not quite as unique!</TEXT>

Went and took it out for a test drive and was amazed at the power it put out for being a 1.8L. I was also amazed at the leg room that it had because I read reviews saying it was small for those with long legs. At 6ft tall I had plenty of room, and I haven't even pushed it back all the way. Overall with options and everything, no other car can compete. Did I mentioned it came with a first aid kit lol.</TEXT>

It handles extremely well and is quite fun to drive. The radio/CD/iPOD controls on the steering wheel makes it easy to listen to the music you want.

<TEXT>I traded in my 2006 Volvo XC90 for the 2008 Scion xD for the gas savings. I get nearly double the gas mileage now. I still use a rear-facing car seat for my baby and it actually fits better in the back seat of the Scion than it did in the Volvo. I think it has as much to do with the shape of the dashboard as it does with the roominess of the back seat, but whatever the reason, the front passenger is always glad not have knees jammed up against the dashboard. Because the xD is tall with a high seating position, downsizing from an SUV was not nearly the adjustment I thought it would be.</TEXT>
